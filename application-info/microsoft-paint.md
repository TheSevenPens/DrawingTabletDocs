# Microsoft Paint

## Basics

* Microsoft Paint (aka MSPAINT) is one of the oldest Microsoft applications available on Microsoft Windows.

## Summary

It's still a relatively primitive application. And although some people do use it to create drawings or paintings there are far better options out there. MSPAINT is still useful though as a tool to do quick edits of images.

## Drawing tablet compatibility

And MSPAINT has two brushes that are pressure sensitive. So it's useful as a way of diagnosing pressure problems with a drawing tablet.

The two pressure-sensitive brushes are:

\-        Watercolor

\-        Oil
