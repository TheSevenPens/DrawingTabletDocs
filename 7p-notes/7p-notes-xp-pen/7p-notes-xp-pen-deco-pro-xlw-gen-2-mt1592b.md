# 7P notes: XP-Pen Deco Pro XLW GEN2 (MT1592B)

## Overview

Starting on 7/26/2023 I installed this tablet and am using it for all my drawing for at least one month. I am still evaluating the tablet.

## **Build quality and design**

Is great across the board. The thing looks and feels great. In this dimension, seems to rival the premium feel of Wacom. Again I am just talking about the materials here and looks. This XP-Pen tablet it seems more modern in its aesthetic than other tablets.

**XP-Pen branding** - The XP-Pen logo is prominently featured on the pen case and at the bottom edge of the tablet. Frankly I think it looks cool and I enjoy being able to visually distinguish the tablet from the many others I have.&#x20;

**Indicator lights on surface**

Four indicator lights are just past the corners of the active area. They will light up if the pen is within 10 mm of the active area. The lights are white. You can turn them off in the driver.

## **Pen**

**Pen model**

It comes with the latest pen: X3 Pro Smart Chip Stylus. The shape is very close to the Wacom Pro Pen 2.&#x20;

**Pen eraser**

The pen has an eraser. I don't use erasers so I don't have opinion of it.

**Pen compatibility**

* X3 Pro Smart Chip Stylus: Compatible
* X3 Elite: NOT compatible

**Disabled buttons impact on drawing**

Good: If you disable the two pen buttons in the driver, and then press the buttons while drawing it doesn't seem to interrupt drawing. I tested this with Clip Studio Paint and Krita on Windows 11.

**16K Pressure levels**

Obligatory 16K pressure level screenshot. This is what it shows in the driver.&#x20;

There is no noticeable impact on my drawing.&#x20;

## **Surface**

**Surface texture** Seems similar to a Wacom Intuos Pro L (PTH-860).

**Replaceable surface?** No.

**Surface details**

* The surface has a nice touch. At the bottom bevel is gently arcs down so that your hands avoid contact with a hard edge.&#x20;
* At surface is a slab that actually hangs over the table like a flat roof. I've never encountered a tablet with this before. It doesn't change how it works, but it is an interesting design choice. I like the look
* Surface edge at the very edge of the surface, the transition from horizontal surface to vertical is not very rounded.&#x20;

## **Buttons**

The tablet itself has none.

## Pen pressure

**Maximum pressure** - Top End of pressure range for the pen seems comparable to the what I am used to with the Huion PW517. Not not as high as Wacom Pro Pen 2.

**Minimum pressure (IAF)**&#x20;

* XP-Pen says 3gf.&#x20;
* It is easy to drag the pen across the surface and even hear the scratch sound without the pen registering pressure.&#x20;
* Compared to Wacom: Wacom Pro Pen 2 is <1gf. The difference in the IAFs is very obvious.&#x20;
* Compared to Huion: It felt to me that this XP-Pen has an IAF larger than the Huion PW517 pen. I need time to evaluate this again.&#x20;

## **Pointer lag**

Initial reaction: Position smoothing is causing some pointer lag. The effect is subtle. But I think even someone who is not a tablet expert would feel that something is just a little "off" even if they didn't have the words to describe it. To me it feels like there's a little bit of drift of the pointer when I stop moving.

* Compared to the Wacom Intuos Pro Large (PTH-860): The XP pen I think has a little more pointer lag. Again it is subtle.
* Compared to the Huion Giano G930L: Not sure.  I will have to dive deeper into it.

I'm going to give it more time to fully evaluate this effect.

## **Diagonal wobble**

Rating: OK

It has more wobble than the Wacom Intuos Pro Large (PTH-860). XP-Pen should be doing better here since it is targeted at a pro audience.

Notice that wobble is present even in the fast stroke.

## Accessories

**Pen case** - Adding the the premium feel is the pen case. Which holds the pen, extra nibs, and nib remover. It really is a slick looking.
