# 7P notes: XP-Pen Artist Pro 16 GEN2 (MD160QH)

My notes are in progress. I have only just received this tablet and haven't had much time to use it.

**Design**

I like the overall design. Looks and feels very premium.

One minor nit. The USB-C cable connects at the top edge this meand you see the cable connect. This is normal for pen displays these days. But it does make the device a little less elegant.

**Ergonomics > Legs**

Two foldable legs on the back allow it to be propped up at an angle. However, I just use a spare HUION stand for a better angle.

**Resolution**

Native resolution is 2560x1600

Excellent resolution. Big improvement over an HD screen.

**Aspect Ratio**

16:10 instead of 16:9

I like the 16:10 Aspect ratio

**Can be connected with a single USB-C cable?**

YES. I tried the cable that it came with and a Thunderbolt 3 cable.

**Express Keys**

None

**Diagonal wobble**

RATING: OK
