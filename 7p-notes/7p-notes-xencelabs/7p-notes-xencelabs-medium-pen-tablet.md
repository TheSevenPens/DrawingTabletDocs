# 7P notes: Xencelabs Pen Tablet Medium (BPH1212W-A)

**Summary**

Had a good experience with this tablet after using for six months.

It's in the same price range as Wacom.

**Build quality**&#x20;

Rating: very good.&#x20;

Comparable to Wacom Intuos Pro GEN2.

**Basic drawing**&#x20;

Rating: very good.&#x20;

I forgot I wasn't using a Wacom Intuos Pro tablet.

**Driver**&#x20;

Rating: Excellent

Driver UX is very friendly and modern in appearance.

**Diagonal Wobble**

Rating: OK (LOW)

With my standard slow-drawing wobble test I did see some wobble. This could be a bit better for a pro tablet. I don't think you'll typically notice the wobble in practice.&#x20;
