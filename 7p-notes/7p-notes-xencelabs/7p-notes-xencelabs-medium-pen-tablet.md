# 7P notes: Xencelabs Medium Pen Tablet (BPH1212W-A)

**Summary**

Had a good experience with this tablet after using for six months.

It's in the same price range as Wacom.

**Build quality** - very solid. Comparable to Wacom Intuos Pro.

**Basic drawing** - very good. I forgot I wasn't using a Wacom Intuos Pro tablet.

**Diagonal wobble** - did not test.

**Driver** - Driver UX is very friendly and modern in appearance.

**Diagonal Wobble** -&#x20;

With my standard slow-drawing, wobble test, the wobble results were OK. This good be a bit better. But I don't think you'll typically notice the wobble in practice.&#x20;
