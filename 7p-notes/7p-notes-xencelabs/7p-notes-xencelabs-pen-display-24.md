# 7P notes: Xencelabs Pen Display 24

**Context**

I had a chance to play with the Xencelabs Pen display in early May at a Xencelabs event in Redmond, WA. I had over an hour to try the tablet.&#x20;

**Hover distance**&#x20;

Rating: TYPICAL Seemed to be about \~10mm (I didn't have a ruler).&#x20;

NOTE: Did not test with OpenTabletDriver which does not enforce height limit unlike every other driver&#x20;

**Edge & Corner accuracy**&#x20;

Rating: EXCELLENT.&#x20;

Extremely accurate at edges and in corners. Best I've seen. Better than Wacom Cintiq Pro 27 (which is also VERY GOOD). Clearly better than Huion Kamvas 24 Pro 4K (which is TYPICAL)&#x20;

**Anti-glare sparkle**

Rating: VERY GOOD. \[LESS IS BETTER] Slight Sparkle only noticeable when eye is \~4" away from glass or closer. At normal drawing distance not visible. On par with Wacom Cintiq Pro 27 (Which is GOOD). Clearly better than with Huion Kamvas 24 Pro 4K (Which is OK)&#x20;

**Pointer Lag**

Rating: Slightly above TYPICAL RANGE \[LESS IS BETTER]&#x20;

Wacom Cintiq Pro clearly has less lag (Which is GOOD) Comparable but not quite matching Huion Kamvas 24 Pro 4K (Which is Typical) - just a little more than the Huion.&#x20;

NOTE: Did not try with OpenTabletDriver. So not clear how much of lag is in firmware versus driver&#x20;

**Etched glass texture**

Rating: FEELS NICE. I felt it had more slightly more texture than the Cintiq Pro 27.&#x20;

**Min pressure (IAF)**

Rating: TYPICAL 3gf specified. That felt accurate. Typical for a non-Wacom pen and low enough for me. Wacom Pro Pen 2 min pressure is <1gf.&#x20;

**Max pressure**

Rating: TYPICAL I did not measure, but seemed typical for a non-Wacom pen. Achieving max pressure didn't require as much force as the Pro Pen 2 models I have. But this max pressure seems fine. Not sure a higher max pressure would be helpful. The Wacom pro pen 2 max (just under 800gf) pressure feels almost a bit too much pressure to apply to the glass surface.&#x20;

**Diagonal wobble**

Rating: DID NOT TEST

I didn't have my plastic ruler with me
