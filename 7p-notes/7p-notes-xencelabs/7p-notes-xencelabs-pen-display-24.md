# 7P notes: Xencelabs Pen Display 24 (LPH2412U-A)

<mark style="color:red;">**I AM CURRENTLY EVALUATING THIS TABLET. MY CURRENT EVALUATION IS BELOW BUT MAY CHANGE AS I USE IT MORE.**</mark>

**Hover distance**&#x20;

Rating: TYPICAL&#x20;

Seemed to be about \~10mm

**Edge & Corner accuracy**&#x20;

Rating: EXCELLENT.&#x20;

Extremely accurate at edges and in corners. Best I've seen. Better than Wacom Cintiq Pro 27 (which is also VERY GOOD). Clearly better than Huion Kamvas 24 Pro 4K (which is TYPICAL)&#x20;

**Anti-glare sparkle**

Rating: VERY GOOD. \[LESS IS BETTER]&#x20;

Slight AG Sparkle only noticeable when eye is \~4" away from glass or closer. At normal drawing distance not visible. On par with Wacom Cintiq Pro 27 (Which is GOOD). Clearly better than with Huion Kamvas 24 Pro 4K (Which is OK)&#x20;

**Color**

I am not a color expert.&#x20;

The one GREAT thing I noticed is that it's sRGB mode doesn't dim the brightness of the display. So many other pen displays and monitors don't reduce brightness in sRGB mode. So, this is very nice to have.&#x20;

**Pointer Lag**

Rating: Slightly above TYPICAL RANGE? \[LESS IS BETTER].&#x20;

Comparisons:

* Wacom Cintiq Pro has a bit less lag&#x20;
* Comparable to but the Huion Kamvas 24 Pro 4K (Which is Typical) - maybe just a little more than the Huion.&#x20;

NOTE: I did not try with OpenTabletDriver. So not clear how much of lag is in firmware versus driver&#x20;

**Etched glass texture**

Rating: EXCELLENT.

It feels really nice. I felt it had more slightly more texture than the Cintiq Pro 27.&#x20;

**Min pressure (IAF)**

Rating: TYPICAL. Xencelabs specifies 3gf. That felt accurate. Typical for a non-Wacom pen and low enough for me. Wacom Pro Pen 2 min pressure is <1gf.&#x20;

**Max pressure**

Rating: TYPICAL&#x20;

I did not measure (there is no way to measure this since the new pen cannot be used with the Xencelabs pen tablet).&#x20;

Achieving max pressure didn't require as much force as the Pro Pen 2 models I have. But this max pressure seems fine. &#x20;

**Diagonal wobble**

Rating: WORSE THAN AVERAGE

Currently seeing a lot diagonal wobble at both slow and medium drawing speeds that requires smoothing to reduce.&#x20;

**Driver**

Rating: EXCELLENT&#x20;

The best user experience and design of any tablet in the industry.

Some negatives:

* Currently the driver cannot handle multiple Xencelabs products attached at the same time.

**Pen**

This pen is physically different than the one that comes with the Xencelabs pen tablet. And they are NOT swappable.

This pen is an improvement from the old pen. The buttons are more prominent and easier to tell apart by touch.
