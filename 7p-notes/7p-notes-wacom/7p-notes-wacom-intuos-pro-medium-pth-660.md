# 7P notes: Wacom Intuos Pro Medium 2017 (PTH-660)

This is a fantastic all-around tablet. It's the best for its size.

I have used one for years and have no problem recommending it.

These days I have moved to using a PTH-860 ([my notes](7p-notes-wacom-intuos-pro-large-pth-860.md)) because I like the larger size though.
