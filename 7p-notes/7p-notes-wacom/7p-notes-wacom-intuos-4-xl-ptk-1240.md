# 7P notes: Wacom Intuos 4 XL (PTK-1240)

I also have used the **Intuos 4 XL** extensively.&#x20;

This is an extra large tablet. Using a tablet at this size is very different.

I made a video showing what my experience with it is like.

**Driver**

Wacom's latest drivers have dropped support for the Intuos 4 tablets - except for the Intuos 4 XL.

**Pen compatibility**

Keep in mind this tablet does not use the more recent pens like Wacom Pro Pen 2.

**Availability**

It hasn't been produced for years. So,  you'll have to find them on eBay. They can range in price from $100 to $500.
