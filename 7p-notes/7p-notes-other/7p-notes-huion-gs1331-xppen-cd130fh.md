# 7P notes: Huion Kamvas 13 vs XP-Pen Artist 13 (2nd Gen)

## One-sentence summary

These are very similar tablets, but overall I would pick the Huion Kamvas 13 as the winner. The overall experience was better.&#x20;

## Model tested

* Huion Kamvas 13 (GS1331)&#x20;
* XP-Pen Artist 13 (2nd Gen) (CD130FH)

## Evaluation notes

#### Testing Setup

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/huion xppen 13 comparison.jpg>)

* **Driver versions used**
  * Huion: 15.6.2.80
  * XP-Pen: 3.4.0
* **Operating system of test machine**
  * Huion: Windows 11
  * XP-Pen: Windows 10
* **Specs**
  * The tables of specs come from the Huion and XP-Pen websites. For some specs, I did some testing to come up with the numbers.
* **Variances**
  * Please remember that how tablets work can vary even with tablets that have the same model number. I cannot guarantee everyone will experience what I encountered.
* **User manuals**
  * Huion - [https://www.huion.com/user-manual-70](https://www.huion.com/user-manual-70)&#x20;
  * XP-Pen - [https://download01.xp-pen.com/file/2022/07/Artist%20Series%20Drawing%20Display%20(2nd%20Gen)(English).pdf](https://download01.xp-pen.com/file/2022/07/Artist%20Series%20Drawing%20Display%20\(2nd%20Gen\)\(English\).pdf)&#x20;
* **Pen labeling**
  * I used gaffer tape to identify the pens. Green = XP-PEN, Red=Huion.

### Center versus Corner Accuracies

In my testing

* Both have similar center accuracy. I agree with their listed specs of ±0.5mm
* Both have similar corner accuracy. I measured at ± 2mm&#x20;

Accuracy in both tablets is very good for a pen display

### Diagonal wobble

Both tablets have excellent diagonal wobble (i.e. very low amounts of diagonal wobble) with both slow and fast strokes.

Compare it to the most expensive pen tablet wacom makes the Wacom Intuos Pro Large (PTH-860):

Both the Huion and XP pen are on par with&#x20;

### Anti-glare sparkle

Both tablets exhibit some anti-glare sparkle. Ideally tablets should exhibit no sparkle.

* iPad -> no observable sparkle
* Wacom Cintiq Pro -> very low sparkle
* Wacom One -> low sparkle&#x20;
* XP-Pen Artist 13 (2nd gen) -> On the low end of moderate sparkle
* Huion Kamvas 13 -> moderate sparkle

For both tablets you'll notice the sparkle if your eyes are close, at a normal drawing distance I don't notice it.

The XP-Pen tablet is clearly the winner over the Huion tablet for AG sparkle.

## Drawing Experience

### Drawing

Both tablets handle these cases well

* drawing lots of dots
* drawing many small quick tiny low pressure lines - hatching
* keeping pressure constant
* moving between high and low pressure smoothly
* Tapering - typical for every pen display I've seen.&#x20;

Overall drawing experience is very good for both tablets.

### Pressure range

* Remember: Pressure is detected by the pen, not the tablet.&#x20;
* The lower bound on the pressure range is called the Initial Activation Force.
* To test this I hung each pen from a string and dragged the tip of the pen across the surface. The goal is that the minimal weight for the pen will draw a continuous line. Here's how they ranked:
  * XP-Pen Artist 13 2nd Gen -> made no marks whatsoever
  * Huion Kamvas 13 -> half the time made a mark. if pen moves slowly mark is captured usually but if there the pen is moving a little faster the mark is not registered.
  * Wacom One -> about same as the Huion Kamvas 13
  * Wacom Intuos Pro Large (PTH-860) -> draws a continuous line
  * Huion Giano (G930L) -> draws a continuous line
* Between the two, Huion is the clear winner with its lower IAF.

### Pointer lag

Both Huion and XP-pen models tested exhibit the typical pointer lag present with all pen displays. The lag is comparable to the Wacom One pen display (DTC-133).

Manufacturers don't publish lag numbers. So, this is subjective:

* The Huion has about the same amount of lag as the Wacom One
* The XP-Pen model has maybe 30% more lag than the Huion model&#x20;

Both tables can be successfully used for creative applications. But Huion is the clear winner here over the XP-Pen model.&#x20;

None of these come close to the pointer lag apparent in an Apple iPad. For that matter neither does the Wacom Cintiq Pro 27.&#x20;

### Parallax

Thanks to their laminated displays both have very good parallax. They match that of Wacom One.

Below is a parallax photo for several pen tablet models. The XP-Pen parallax similar to the picture of the Wacom One and Huion model in the photo.

## Cabling

### Connecting with a 3 in 1 cable

Both tablets come with a 3-in-1 cable.&#x20;

The end that goes into the tablet is USB-C.

The other 3 ends are:

* HDMI - connect to computer
* USB-A for data - connect to computer
* USB-A for power - this cable is colored red.&#x20;
  * if your computer can provide enough power you can plug the cable into the computer
  * Or you can connect to a USB power adapter. Neither tablet comes with a USB power adapter.

### Connecting with one USB-C cable

For both tablets, I was able to use a single USB-C cable to connect them to the computer. More here: [Connecting a pen display with one USB-C cable](../../guides/pen-displays/connecting-a-pen-display-with-one-usb-c-cable.md)&#x20;
