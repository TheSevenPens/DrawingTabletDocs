# 7P notes: TourBox

## Summary

I really like this device and hate drawing without it.

As of August of 2023 I have been using a TourBox device for over two years. For me it's become a primary tool as I work on digital art. I have multiple drawing workstations each one has an individual TourBox device attached to it. For me it is a required piece of equipment as I draw.

## Adjustment time

When I first acquired this device, I used it for about a month and then quit. It was very difficult for me to remember to use the device. I would often end up falling back to using my normal keyboard shortcuts.

I could not adjust to it. And so I put it back in its box and left it there untouched for a couple of months.

After some time I had a particularly frustrating drawing session where I was heavily using the keyboard. And I kept feeling like hitting the keyboard shortcuts was slowing me down. And for that reason I decided to try to retrain myself on the TourBox device. So I brought it out of storage. And made a concerted effort to use the device.

It took a lot of reading about the device, experimenting with different configuration options, and forcing myself to avoid using the keyboard. But eventually after about six months my brain was fully trained to use the device instead of relying on keyboard shortcuts. I think it was well worth that investment of time. Because it made me much more productive.

## What I like about the TourBox

Well again it is a key tool when I draw. I certainly do not enjoy drawing without having it around. It has become a necessity. So in a fundamental sense it is delivering a lot of value and solving the problems it is intended to solve.&#x20;

Another great thing about the TourBox is that the TourBox console - the accompanying software application - is very user friendly. It is very easy to configure the device in general and to create configurations for specific applications. Another great feature of the application is it has an auto switching feature which you can enable or disable. This is very important because this means switch between windows, the appropriate configuration for that application will be used by the TourBox. You don't have to manually switch it settings.

The software is also updated quite frequently.

The TourBox NEO supports only a wired USB connection.

The TourBox ULTRA supports both wired and Bluetooth connection. One negative of the ultra for me is that it uses normal non rechargeable batteries. So that's kind of irritating to have to replace them every now and then.

## Ways in which the TourBox could be better for me

I wish the dials and wheels had a little more resistance to movement. I have this scroll wheel set to control my brush size. And sometimes I accidentally brush against it and change my brush size and I don't notice that until later. I don't use the large spinning dial at all. I had it set to rotate the canvas. But then I was accidentally rotating my canvas far too often. So now I do not use the dial it all.

The software is very highly configurable. The TourBox has keys that can use as modifiers with other keys. O for example one of the keys can act like a shift key. But not all keys can be programmed this way. And there is one key that I wish I could program this way because it would give me more opportunities to bind tools to the buttons on the tour box.

Remember I have multiple machines that have two boxes. One nice feature of the TourBox is that it lets export the configuration for a specific app and then import it on another machine. It would be nice if I could export and import all the configurations at once. Another idea which would be nice for me is to have the TourBox software automatically sync so that all my TourBox devices have the same configuration without me having to go through the export import process.

In windows there's also an interesting limitation. This has to deal with apps like concepts which are not normal windows applications but are ones designed for the Microsoft Store. Apparently these applications are built differently. And the TourBox device cannot set a profile for those applications. An example of such an application is the concepts app. I really enjoy sketching with this application. But the TourBox cannot bind to it. So I cannot have an application specific configuration for it. I do not know if this limitation is because of the TourBox software or how windows works or a combination of both those factors.
