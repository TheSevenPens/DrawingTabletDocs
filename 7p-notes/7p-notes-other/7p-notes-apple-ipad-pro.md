# 7P notes: Apple iPad Pro

## How I use iPads

I use iPads for drawing - but mostly when I am at not my desk or when I am mobile. Otherwise when sitting at my desk I prefer to use a pen tablet or pen display.&#x20;

I use these iPad models with an Apple Pencil 2:

* Apple iPad Pro (12.9 inch) (3rd gen) - Does NOT support hover
* Apple iPad Pro (11 inch) (4rd gen) - Does support hover.

I primarily these use iPad apps&#x20;

* [Procreate](../../applications/procreate.md)
* [Clip Studio Paint](../../applications/clip-studio-paint.md) &#x20;

I occasionally use these iPad apps

* [Concepts](../../applications/concepts-app.md)  &#x20;

## Transferring files between iPads and Windows

One easy way to send files easily back and forth between an iPad and Windows is to use a file syncing service. For example OneDrive - which is what I use.

I put my Clip Studio Paint files in a OneDrive folder and sync them to multiple PCs and my iPad. This allows me to edit them with whatever device I want. And changes are automatically synced to all the devices. &#x20;
