# 7P notes: Huion Inspiroy Giano (G930L)

## **Summary**

Introduced in 2022, the Giano G930L is a fantastic value. It's quite nice for drawing and I enjoy the extra size.&#x20;

## **Compared to Wacom**

Its competitor is the Wacom Intuos Pro Large (PTH-860), and the Giano has some interesting differences:

* The Giano G930L costs about $200 where the Wacom Intuos Pro Large (PTH-860) costs about $500
* The Giano's active area is slightly larger than the Wacom Intuos Pro

## **Pen**

Comes with the Huion PW517 pen.&#x20;

## **Surface texture**

Definitely has a textured surface. Comparable to the Wacom Intuos Pro in amount of texture.

## **Scenario**

I use it connected to my work computer and draw and sketch with it every couple of weeks. So it isn't my main creative tablet but it's worked well for that purpose.

## **Wireless**

One minor nit: By default, the tablet when connected will still go to sleep apparently to conserve its battery. This isn't a problem because you go into the driver and turn off this sleep behavior. &#x20;

## **OLED display**

There's a monochromatic OLED display on the upper left of the tablet. This is a nice feature that lets you see the battery level easily.

## **Working with a large tablet**

Large tablets require some adjustment to work with. If you are interested learning more about howe your workflow and desk may need to adjust watch this video: [https://youtu.be/YCmVugc3w\_g](https://youtu.be/YCmVugc3w\_g)&#x20;

## Pressure pulsing

Minor pressure pulsing visible at lower pressure. Will mostly be be visible with strokes using large brushes.
