# 7P notes: Huion Kamvas Pro 24 4K (GT2401)

**Summary**

I've been very satisfied with this tablet.

**Cost**

This Huion tablet not cheap at about $1300. But sometimes it is on sale at $1000.&#x20;

**Compared to Wacom**

* This is Huion's highest end pen display in 2023.&#x20;
* Its competitor is the Wacom Cintiq Pro 27.&#x20;
* Let me be clear, the Cintiq Pro 27 is a better tablet. But this tablet delivers a LOT for value for it's price. This Huion tablet delivers 90% of what you need for drawing compared to the Cintiq Pro 27's which costs $3500.

**Accuracy** - Good. Like all pen displays slightly inaccurate in the edges and corner by a couple of millimeters. More accurate in edges/corners than the Huion Kamvas 22 Plus.

**Pointer lag** - Normal for a pen display. Slightly more than the Cintiq Pro 27.

**Stand -** does not come with a stand.

**Legs** - Has bult-in legs that give it a nice drawing angle.

**VESA** - is VESA mountable

**Anti-glare sparkle -** Low. Noticeable if you put your eyes close. At a normal drawing distance my eyes don't pick it up or at least it looks minimal.

**Express Keys** - It has none. So, I use keyboard shorts with this device: [tourbox](../../accessories/tourbox.md)

**Heat** - display stays cool to the touch - maybe sometimes slightly warm. No hot spots.

**Scenario** - I bought this tablet for digital art, and it works fine for that. I have used it as a secondary display at it works fine for that purpose also. But most of the time I only use it when I want to draw.

**How I connect it**

There are two cables running from the tablet.

* display signal and data - I connect it via a single USB-C Thunderbolt 3 cable to one my Surface Pro 8's 2 USB-C Thunderbolt 4 ports.
* power - I connect it using Huions power adapter to the wall.&#x20;

**Diagonal wobble**

Rating: VERY GOOD (LOW AMOUNT OF WOBBLE)

Wobble is minor and only noticeable in very slow strokes.
