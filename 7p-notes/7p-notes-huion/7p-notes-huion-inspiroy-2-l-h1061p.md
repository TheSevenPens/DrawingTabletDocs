# 7P notes: Huion Inspiroy 2 L (H1061P)

## **Summary**

<mark style="color:red;">**I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS THIS TABLET CURRENTLY**</mark>

I only tried this tablet for about a week. I liked it very much initially.&#x20;

In Sept 2023 a Reddit user told me about some bad pressure handling. I confirmed this is the case. Until Huion issues a firmware or driver fix for this problem I cannot recommend this tablet. &#x20;

## **Drawing experience**

Has TERRIBLE pressure handling.

I have personally seen this problem with 2 separate Inspiroy 2 L models. And I know of at least 2 others who have found this problem in their models.

I cannot say that every model has this problem, but it seems frequent enough that I would avoid this tablet.

## <mark style="color:red;">**Pressure problems**</mark>

Tablet experiences extremely unstable pressure causing extreme pulsing of strokes.&#x20;

Example: With Krita Ink3 GPen brush with default settings and size set to 400 pixels.&#x20;

The pulsing is also visible in smaller brushes - for example 100 pixels.&#x20;

The effect is not noticeable with small brushes for example 5 pixels.

Huion needs to address this problem with an update.

This behavior seems hardware-related. It occurs with both when using the Huion driver and OpenTabletDriver.

## **Pen**

Comes with the PW110 pen

## **Other compatible pens**

I tried it with a PW517 pen it worked.

## **Size**

Huion puts L in the name of this tablet to identify it is as a "large" tablet. However this tablet is close to size to medium tablets like the Wacom Intuos Pro medium (PTH-660) it is nowhere close to the true large size of something like the Wacom Intuos Pro Large (PTH-860) or the Huion Inspiroy Giano G930L.

## **Wireless**

Does NOT support wireless connectivity. Must be connected with USB cable.

## **Express keys**

I really enjoyed the flexibility of how the buttons work with the group keys. Even though there are 8 buttons, with the three group keys, you get effectively 8x3 = 24 buttons.&#x20;

## **Compared RTP-700**

This model has physical buttons, unlike the capacitive buttons of the RTP-700.&#x20;

## **Compared to the XP Deco LW**

Similar drawing experience (except for the pressure issue), but I like the extra buttons capabilities and the scroller of the Inspiroy 2 L.

The Huion PW517 pen has a lower (better) initial activation force than the pen that comes with the XP Deco LW.



## Pressure instability testing

## Test 1 on 2023/12/6

* firmware: T21m 221228
* app: Krita
* brush: ink-3 G pen, 500px
* driver: v15.6.2.80
* comments: strong pulsing effect at lower pressues. Size of brush jumps dramatically up and down.

## Test 2 on 2023/12/6

* firmware: T21m 221228
* app: Krita
* brush: ink-3 G pen, 500px
* driver: v15.7.6.753
* comments: pulsing still strongly present at lower pressures but with this driver the effect is smoother.
