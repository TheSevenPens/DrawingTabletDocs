# 7P notes: Huion Inspiroy 2 L (H1061P)

<mark style="color:red;">**I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS THIS TABLET CURRENTLY**</mark>

I only tried this tablet for about a week. I liked it very much initially.&#x20;

\[Update Sept 2023] a reddit told me about some bad pressure handling. I confirmed this is the case. Until Huion issues a firmware or driver fix for this problem I cannot recommend this tablet. &#x20;

**Drawing experience**

Overall felt good bud has bad pressure handling.

**Pressure problems**

Tablet experiences extremely unstable pressure causing extreme pulsing of strokes.&#x20;

Example: With Krita Ink3 GPen brush with default settings and size set to 400 pixels.&#x20;

The pulsing is also visible in smaller brushes - for example 100 pixels.&#x20;

You will not notice with small brushes for example 5 pixels.

Huion needs to address this problem with an update.

This behavior confirmed by two more people.

**Pen**

Comes with the PW110 pen

**Other compatible pens**

I tried it with a PW517 pen it worked.

**Size**

Huion puts L in the name of this tablet to identify it is as a "large" tablet. However this tablet is close to size to medium tablets like the Wacom Intuos Pro medium (PTH-660) it is nowhere close to the true large size of something like the Wacom Intuos Pro Large (PTH-860) or the Huion Giano G930L.

**Wireless**

Does NOT support wireless connectivity. Must be connected with USB cable.

**Express keys**

I really enjoyed the flexibility of how the buttons work with the group keys. Even though there are 8 buttons, with the three group keys, you get effectively 8x3 = 24 buttons.&#x20;

**Compared RTP-700**

I think it's better choice than the RTP-700 because it has physical buttons, unlike the capacitive buttons of the RTP-700.&#x20;

**Compared to the XP Deco LW**

Similar drawing experience, but I like the extra buttons capabilities and the scroller of the Inspiroy 2 L.

However, I do think the Huion PW517 pen has a lower (better) initial activation force than the pen that comes with the XP Deco LW.
