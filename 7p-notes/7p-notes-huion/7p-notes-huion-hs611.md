# 7P notes: Huion Inspiroy HS611

**Summary**

The Huion HS611 is a decent drawing tablet.&#x20;

**Age**

This is a slightly older Huion model from 2019 using the slightly older PW507 pen. If you have to get it, then it will work fine. But I think now you'll find the newer and better Huion pen tablets at the same price point as the HS611.&#x20;

**Design**

The HS611 lacks the refined look and feel of the newer Huion tablets. The pen is a little "plastic-feeling" and cheap and the nib retracts a little more than I like. Despite all that it's a perfectly fine drawing experience.&#x20;

**Surface texture**

The drawing surface is very slightly textured. The texture feels smoother than the Wacom Intuos Pro (PTH-x60 series).&#x20;

**ExpressKeys**

It has 10 programmable buttons on the left - more than most other tablets.

In addition, at the top there are some additional media control keys which are convenient.
