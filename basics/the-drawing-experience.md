# The drawing experience

## G**etting strokes right the first time**

With a **pen display** you can see exactly where the stroke is going to be. Many people who use pen displays say that they get the stroke right the first time.&#x20;

Some people feel that with a **pen tablet**, they would have to make the stroke several times to get it right and press undo to erase the mistakes.&#x20;

I generally agree with these statements. When I want to do line work faster with less UNDOs, I often use pen display instead of a pen tablet.

## Matching hand movements and drawing

With a **pen display**, things are natural. You see the pen in the same place the stroke is being drawn - just like when you use pen and paper.

And just like pen-and-paper, your own hand and the pen will block your eyes from seeing the display. The easy solution to this is to reposition your eyes or take advantage of the canvas zoom and rotation features of your drawing app.

With a **pen tablet**, you are looking at a monitor but drawing somewhere else with your hand. Fundamentally this is no different than using a mouse.&#x20;

Just like a mouse, the operating system and drawing programs will usually show the position of the pen on the canvas, so you will have some visual feedback of the position of the pen even if you are not drawing.

One advantage of this disconnect between what you see and what your hand is doing, is that the pen and your hand do not block your visibility of what you are drawing. That can be convenient.

Still, some people struggle with the disconnect. Usually they can train themselves out of this within a complex of weeks. But some people just can't get used to it.



## Matching aspect ratios

With a pen display, the active are and the screen have the same size. This means the pen will draw exactly where you see it draw.

With a pen tablet, the active area where you raw is separate from the monitor where you see the your strokes. Unless specifically configured in the driver, this will cause your strokes to be distorted. For example if you draw a circle on the tablet it will show up as an oval on the screen. It is easy to fix this problem in the driver. More here: [**match aspect ratios between pen tablets and monitors**](../guides/core-features/active-area-aspect-ratio.md).
