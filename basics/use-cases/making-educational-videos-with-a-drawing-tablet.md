# Making educational videos with a drawing tablet

Drawing tablets are heavily used for creating educational content. For example you've probably seen the Khan Academy videos and those are created with a drawing tablet.

## Easy tablet choices

For this you want high reliability and durability and you DO NOT need to spend a lot of money buying a fancy tablet. And for those reasons I'll keep the recommendations short:

## What features you need

* Pressure support - Will help you strokes look more natural. All drawing tablets have this pressure support.
* Tilt - not needed for education use. More of an artist thing.
* Tablet buttons (aka. ExpressKeys) - I think they can come in very useful for people. For some people these are critical. No harm in getting them, you can always disable them.&#x20;
* Size - Medium or Small. I always recommend medium. Even though some people are OK with small tablets, I do see a far number of people say the small size makes their hand feel cramped.&#x20;

## **My recommendations**

**Pen tablets (no screen)**

* One by Wacom Medium (CTL-672)
  * Pressure: YES
  * Tilt: NO
  * Tablet Buttons: NO
  * Wireless: NO
* Wacom Intuos Medium (CTL-6100 or CTL-6100WL)&#x20;
  * Pressure: YES
  * Tilt: NO
  * Tablet buttons: YES
  * Wireless: Only the CTL-6100WL supports wireless

**Pen displays (have a screen)**

* XP-Pen Artist 12 GEN2 (CD120FH)
  * Pressure: YES
  * Tilt: YES
  * Tablet buttons: YES
  * Wireless: NO
* XP-Pen Artist 13 GEN2 (CD130FH)
  * Pressure: YES
  * Tilt: YES
  * Tablet buttons: YES
  * Wireless: NO
* Wacom One GEN1 (DTC-133)
  * Pressure: YES
  * Tilt: YES
  * Tablet buttons: NO
  * Wireless: NO

## Which tablet does Sal Khan use?

Sal Khan uses a Wacom Intuos Pro Medium for his videos. That is an AMAZING tablet, but honestly overkill. You can get by with a much less expensive tablet.

**Which specific model of Intuos Pro he is using?**

It does NOT look to be the latest model of Intuos Pro Medium (PTH-660). You can tell this because in [**one of his videos**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcqPMKAVM04) he shows the tablet and I can see some things that clearly mark it as an older tablet.

* The pen does not look like the Wacom Pro Pen 2 that comes with the PTH-660
* The USB-cable connects with a thicker end and is not the L-shaped connector that comes PTH-660&#x20;
* The back of the tablet has the older Wacom branding.&#x20;

Note that the Khan Academy has this document [**What software program/equipment is used to make Khan Academy videos?**](https://support.khanacademy.org/hc/en-us/articles/202483430-What-software-program-equipment-is-used-to-make-Khan-Academy-videos) In that doc, they say he uses a Wacom Bamboo tablet. I suspect this probably was true at some point, but he clearly no longer uses it.&#x20;
