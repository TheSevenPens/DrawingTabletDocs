# Taking notes with drawing tablets

## Overview

If you need to take notes and especially if you need to be mobile, rather than a drawing tablet I recommend either [**mobile computers with pen support**](../../recommendations/mobile-computer-recommendations.md) or explore dedicated note-taking devices.

## Dedicated note taking devices

I don't use these devices myself. Here are some popular ones.

* Onyx Boox Note Air3&#x20;
* Remarkable 2
* Amazon Kindle Scrive

### Negatives of pen tablets&#x20;

* **Size.** Small pen tablets don't offer much space for writing and it can feel cramped. A medium pen tablet is better, but then it takes up much more space.
* **Lack of a screen**. It can be awkward to take notes on as you cannot directly see what you are writing.

### Negatives of using pen displays&#x20;

* **Connection.** Pen displays need to be connected to a computer. Although many pen tablets can work wirelessly.
* **Power.** Pen displays need to be connected to a significant source of power. Even if the tablet can get power from a computer, a laptop may not supply enough power (even if the laptop is plugged into power) or the power requirement may drain the laptop battery quickly.
* **Complex connection.** Ideally you would use a single cable to connect a pen display to a computer. But for various reasons this is not always possible. As an alternative you may be required to have a more complex cabling arrangement - often using a 3-in-1 cable. More here about [**using one USB-C cable with a pen display**](../../guides/pen-displays/connecting-a-pen-display-with-one-usb-c-cable.md).&#x20;
* **Pointer lag.** Pen displays have a lot of pointer lag - this can be very difficult to deal with when taking notes - especially if you write fast. More here: [**lag**](../../guides/core-features/lag.md) &#x20;
* **Dropping the tablet.** If you are note taking in a location where you might drop your pen display, in many cases you will either experience a cracked screen or simply break the tablet entirely. &#x20;
