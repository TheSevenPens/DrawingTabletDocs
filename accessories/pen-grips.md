# Pen grips

## Overview

Some pens let you swap out the grip area of the pen to customize the feeling of the pen.

## Wacom Pro Pen 3

This pen comes with several different grips or can be used without a grip.

## Hagurumado woodcrafts

Hagurumado woodcrafts ([https://hagurumado.com/](https://hagurumado.com/)) offers wooden grips for select models of Wacom pens.

I have this model ([https://pinion.thebase.in/items/26608192](https://pinion.thebase.in/items/26608192)) shown below which I use with a KP-504E pen. It was easy to swap out the original grip. The wood adds some "warmth" to the touch and just looks very elegant.

## Make your own grip

Some people make their own grips using

* Raquetball tape
* Hockey tape
* Suguru (See this [reddit thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/huion/comments/mcefso/comment/gs3ew7e/?utm\_source=share\&utm\_medium=web2x\&context=3))
