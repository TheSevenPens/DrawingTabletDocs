# Protective sheets

## Overview

There are various kinds of protectors available to help you preserve your investment in your tablet. Chiefly they protect against permanent scratches in your tablet. You'll want to avoid these scratches because if they get big enough they can be irritating to draw. Also they can be large enough to deflect the tip of the pen - making it impossible to draw a smooth straight line because the pen will suddenly move as it jumps while moving over the scratch.

## Why they work

The EMR signal of a in a drawing tablet and pen travels right through non-metallic materials. It's clear this must be true since with a pen tablet the signal passes right through the plastic surface of a pen tablet. Likewise, for a pen display the signal passes through glass.

## Pen displays vs pen tablets

Some of the protection options are only relevant for pen tablets because they are not transparent. Pen displays will need something close to transparent to be used. For each option I have indicated whether it can be used for a pen display.

## Amount of anti-glare sparkle

For pen displays that use clear sheets, you have to consider if the have an anti-glare treatment and how much anti-glare sparkle they cause. more here: [**anti-glare sparkle**](../guides/pen-displays/anti-glare-sparkle.md).

Some people are very sensitive to the amount of sparkle. So factor that into your choice.

## Built-in screen protection on pen displays

Some pen displays arrive with a film already on top of the screen. The purpose of this screen is to prevent glare and protect the glass.  It may be possible to replace that film.&#x20;

Contact your manufacturer to see if they sell replacement films.

**Can be used for pen displays?** YES, by definition. These forms of protection come with the pen display.

Some specific examples of pen displays with replaceable sheets:

* The **Huion Kamvas 13** has a protective film on top of it that can be replaced: [Huion - How to Replace Huion Pen Display Screen Protector](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B8CyIZfX8co)

## ePlastic polycarbonate sheets (velvet lexan)

Fellow tablet enthusiast, Kuuube, uses velvet lexan sheets.

**Product**

ePlastics 0.010" X 24" X 48" VELVET/MATTE ([https://www.eplastics.com/AF0102448-8B35-VEL-MATTE](https://www.eplastics.com/AF0102448-8B35-VEL-MATTE))

**Size and cutting**

These sheets from ePlastics are very large: 24"x48". When you order them you can specify how to cut them to fit your tablet exactly. You will also have to pay for the cuts. The burden on getting the correct dimensions is on you. You will receive the exact dimensions you wanted and you will receive any excess leftover parts of the sheet.&#x20;

**Texture**

One side has a texture and the other is smoother but not slippery. So depending on yuor preference, you can place that side up.

**Attaching to the tablet**

These sheets do NOT come with an adhesive.&#x20;

They can be secured done to the tablet with:

* regular tape. I sometimes use gaffer tape on the edges. It is ugly and inelegant, but it works.
* adhesive transfer tape such as: [https://www.amazon.com/468MP-Adhesive-Transfer-width-length/dp/B007Y7D4A0/](https://www.amazon.com/468MP-Adhesive-Transfer-width-length/dp/B007Y7D4A0/)

**Can be used for pen displays?** NO. They are not transparent enough.

## Touch support

If your tablet supports touch, then placing a plastic protective sheet on top will not interefere with touch. And it makes sense that it would will work, because the touch sensor is already underneath a layer of plastic of a pen tablet or under a layer of glass for a pen display. So adding another layer of plastic should not affect touch support.
