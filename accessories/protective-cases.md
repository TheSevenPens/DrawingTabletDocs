# Protective cases

## **Overview**

Especially if you are traveling you should consider getting a protective case so that your tablet does not get damaged.

* For pen tablets they can get easily scratched.
* For pen displays not only can they get scratched, but you might crack the glass, or a drop my break something inside.
* Even your pens may deserve some amount of protection. As I've mentioned many times if you drop your pen especially with the nib hitting the floor you can really damage your pen irreparably.

Below are some options that I have seen people suggest. <mark style="color:red;">**I don't own any of these cases so I cannot speak from direct personal experience**</mark>. So make sure do you research and get community feedback on what works for them.

## Notes on iPad cases

**Possible magnetic interference** - Something to look out for.  Some cases have magnets that can interfere with the Apple Pencil. See [**this reddit post**](https://www.reddit.com/r/ipad/comments/1d93ew0/some\_magnetic\_cases\_may\_interfere\_with\_the\_apple/).
