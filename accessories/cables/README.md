# Cables

## Connecting pen tablets

Pen tablets, because they do not have a screen, don't draw much power and don't transmit a lot of data.&#x20;

So any USB 2.0 cable will work that fits the tablet and that **carries data**.&#x20;

For my pen tablets, none of them are connected to the PC with the cable provided by the tablet manufacturer. I always use my own cables.

The specific USB 2.0 cables I use are these:

Specifically I use these with these tablets:

* Wacom Intuos Pro Large (PTH-860)
* Wacom Intuos Pro Medium (PTH-660)
* Huion Giano (G930L)
* Huion HS611

And I use these cables with many other devices that only need USB 2.0 connectivity.

I specifically choose the blue color so that I can visually identify it is a USB 2.0 cable.&#x20;
