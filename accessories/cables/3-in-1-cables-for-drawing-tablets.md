Why do these cables exist?

* simplifies the physical design of the tablet
* It's not always possible to use a single USB-C cable for many reasons
  * USB-C ports on your computer may not supply enough power
  * USB-C ports on your computer may not support sending a display signal (aka DP alt mode)
  * Your computer may not have a USB-C port at all
