# Extension cables

### Overview

Sometimes your cable's just aren't long enough. to solve that problem you can purchase extension cables.&#x20;

You just have to make sure that the cable you purchase supports what you need. For example, an extension cable for a pen tablet is very easy to Purchas because a pen tablet doesn't require much power or data. However, if you want to use an USB-C extension cable for a pen display, you may need to ensure that is supports sending enough power or a display signal depending on hwo you intend to use the cable.

To better understand the needs of connecting a pen display see: [**Connecting a pen display**](../guides/connections-and-cabling/connecting-a-pen-display.md).

## The extension cable I use for pen displays

I use a 2 foot UseBean USB-C Extension cable. This product has worked well for me. I have run up to 4K@60Hz using this extension cable. &#x20;

I used it in these ways:

* With a Huion Kamvas 22 Plus: I connect it to the USB-C end of a Huion 3-in-1 cable.&#x20;
* With Wacom Cintiq Pro 16 (DTH-167): I connect it to the the USB-C cable that came with the Cintiq.

## Be aware of how deeply the port is housed in the pen display

The specific USB-C extender above has a USB-port that fits into some pen displays, but some other pen displays have their USB-C port deeper inside and this cable cannot fit into those areas.

For example, this extender does NOT go deep enough to fit into a Huion Kamvas 13.&#x20;
