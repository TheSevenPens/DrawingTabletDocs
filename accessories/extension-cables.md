# Extension cables

### Overview

Sometimes your cable's just aren't long enough. However, you can purchase extension cables.&#x20;

Key requirements for an extension cable

* For pen tablets
  * It needs to support data and small amount of power - any USB 2.0 extension cable should work
* For pen displays
  * It must support data
  * It must support DP alt mode
  * it must support the resolution and refresh rate you need
  * it must support sending enough power to your pen display
  * <mark style="color:red;">**SAFETY CRITICAL**</mark> it must support AT LEAST as much power as the tablet's original cable. If it is not rated to handle that much power it will be a safety / fire risk.

To better understand the needs of connecting a pen display see: [**Connecting a pen display**](../guides/connections-and-cabling/connecting-a-pen-display.md).

## The extension cable I use for pen displays

I use a 2 foot UseBean USB-C Extension cable. This product has worked well for me. I have run up to 4K@60Hz using this extension cable. &#x20;

I used it in these ways:

* With a Huion Kamvas 22 Plus: I connect it to the USB-C end of a Huion 3-in-1 cable.&#x20;
* With Wacom Cintiq Pro 16 (DTH-167): I connect it to the the USB-C cable that came with the Cintiq.

## Be aware of how deeply the port is housed in the pen display

The specific USB-C extender above has a USB-port that fits into some pen displays, but some other pen displays have their USB-C port deeper inside and this cable cannot fit into those areas.

For example, this extender does NOT go deep enough to fit into a Huion Kamvas 13.&#x20;
