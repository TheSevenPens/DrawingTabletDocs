# Stands

If you are looking for iPad stands go here: [**iPad stands**](https://www.amazon.com/HUION-Adjustable-Drawing-Displays-Suitable/dp/B09C5YJFGS)

There are several options for stands.

##

## VESA-attached stands&#x20;

These stands attach to the back of tablet via screws. Because they are VESA compatible, they work with any drawing tablet that is VESA mountable. For example, I use the **Huion ST100A** with my Wacom Cintiq Pro 27.

Some people have had success with the Ergotron Neo-Flex Stand. See this reddit thread: [https://www.reddit.com/r/wacom/comments/1b527hs/finally\_found\_a\_stand\_for\_my\_cintiq\_pro\_27/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wacom/comments/1b527hs/finally\_found\_a\_stand\_for\_my\_cintiq\_pro\_27/)&#x20;

It's important to match the stand with the height of the pen display. A stand designed for a smaller pen display will have its angle adjustment lever in a position so that it is convenient to reach by putting your hand over the top of the display. However when used with a large display that lever may be much more difficult to reach.



## Unattached stands

Here's a good example for Parblo

I've never used this specific stand, but it illustrated the key features you need:

* It is height adjustable
* It had a "lip" at the bottom to help secure the tablet
* The tablet is not attached to the stand

These stands are simple and inexpensive, but beware that since the tablet is not secured to the stand, it can be easy to knock the tablet of the stand.
