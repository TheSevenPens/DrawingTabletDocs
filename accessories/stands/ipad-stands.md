## Sketchboard Pro for iPad

The Sketchboard Pro for iPads provides a stand which integrates the iPad into the surface. I use it occasionally for when I paint on my iPad.

**Some notes**

* It is a little expensive for what it is, but I do enjoy it.
* Comes in different sizes to fit your iPad
* Still leaves space for charging the Apple Pencil 2 and a USB-C cable connection
* iPad relatively secure in it in normal use. But I would not suggest holding it upside down to test whether the iPad will fall out.
* The extra bezel area is nice. At first I thought it was going to be too big. But it's very comfortable.
