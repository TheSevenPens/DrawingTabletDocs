# 7P notes: VIVO Pneumatic Arm Monitor Desk Stand (STAND-V100R)

## Overall

I am very happy with this stand. It makes it easy to use my pen displays as a monitor and then put them in a position that is convenient for drawing.

## VESA

It does support VESA mounting.

## Assembly

The stand comes in several pieces. The package comes with the screws and two hex wrenches.

Putting it together is not difficult. And the user manual is clear on what to do.

You will need a Philips-head screwdriver to attach it to a pen display with the provided screws.

## Wobble

Like all stands and arms thee is some wobble if you press on it. This is normal and was not a disappointment.

However, there is a good range of motion and adjusting so that the bottom edge of my 22" pen display touches the desk helps tremendously in stabilizing it.

Tensiona adjustment

The tension on the arm is adjustable with one of the provided hex wrenches. I turned down the tension to work with my 22" pen display.

## Other notes

The base was surprisingly heavy.&#x20;
