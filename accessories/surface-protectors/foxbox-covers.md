# Foxbox covers

Foxbox: [**https://foxbox.io/**](https://foxbox.io/)

Foxbox makes **customized** protective covers. You can add an image to your cover to personalize it in any way you want.

**Can be used for pen displays?** NO. They are opaque.

**Texture:** These covers are more textured than the standard Wacom surface.&#x20;

**Thickness:** 0.3mm (I measured with a digital caliper)

Here's the foxbox cover I ordered for my Wacom Intuos Pro (PTH-860):&#x20;
