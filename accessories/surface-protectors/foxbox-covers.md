# Foxbox covers

## Overview

Foxbox ([**https://foxbox.io/**](https://foxbox.io/)) makes **customized** protective covers. You can add an image to your cover to personalize it in any way you want.

## **Who uses these covers?**

These covers are very popular in the osu! gaming community.&#x20;

## **Can be used for pen displays?**&#x20;

NO. FoxBox only sells opaque covers that are useful for pen tablets.

## **Texture**

These covers are WAY MORE TEXTURED than any pen tablet surface. Honestly are probably too textured and will eat up nibs. I was using this FoxBox cover while testing a metal nib so nib wear was not a concern.&#x20;

## **Thickness**

I measured the thickness at 0.3mm with a digital caliper/

## **Durability**

These are very durable. I'm sure I could scratch them if I tried to with a knife or some sharp edge but I think a plastic nib would not be doing much to the surface.

## Removal

They are not difficult to remove.

However, you should be a little careful with an Intuos Pro medium or Large which have removable texture sheets. When I removed the Foxbox cover I wasn't paying attention and actually removed both the Foxbox cover and removable sheet. So pay attention to that if you use these with an Intuos Pro.&#x20;
