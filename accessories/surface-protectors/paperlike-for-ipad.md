## Using Paperlike with drawing tablets

Some people want more texture and have suggested trying paper like on drawing tablets. I gave this a  brief test with a **pen tablet**. Here are my thoughts:

* It's the texture is **strongly dependent on the nib material**. For example:
  * Apple pencil - The texture is very apparent. Pencil clearly grips the surface
  * Huion PW550 (felt nib) - a little less texture than the surface of the Huion Kamvas Pro 19
  * Wacom Pro Pen 2 - the texture was a little less than the Intuos Pro standard texture
  * Wacom Pro Pen 3 - the texture was a little less than the Intuos Pro standard texture
* Overall I didn't find it worth it for pen tablets.
* Generally: I wouldn't describe the feeling "like paper". but when working with the Apple Pencil it definitely adds a lot more grip to the surface. Unfortunately that doesn't extend to the drawing tablet pens i tried.&#x20;
