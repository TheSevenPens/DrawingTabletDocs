## Using Paperlike with drawing tablets

Some people want more texture and have suggested trying paper like on drawing tablets. I cgave this a  brief test with a **pen tablet** (no screen). Here are my thoughts:

* it was large enough to cover the active area of an Intuos Pro medium (PTH-660)
* It's the texture is strongly dependent on the nib material
* for example with the Pro Pen 2 - the surface felt slightly less textured than the intuos pro standard texture.
* with the apple pencil the texture is more apparent - the intuos pro surface feels slick but the paperlike grips the pen a lot more
* overall I didn't find it worth it.
* certainly I wouldn't call the feeling "like paper" its just a little more grippy on the nib
