**Film choices**

Photodon has different types of film. Some have more anti-glare effect and some have less. Instead of guessing which one will work for you, order Photodon's sample kits so you can try out a little piece of the screen protection before you decide to purchase the full sheet.&#x20;

Of the films they have, the one that reduced glare but didn't add too much AG sparkle was the Photodon MXT AG film. Photodon ranks this as a "50%" reduction in glare.&#x20;

**Can these protectors be used for pen displays?** YES.

I experimented with some Photodon films in June of 2026. You can see my experiments here: [https://youtu.be/3x5pfmbsQys](https://youtu.be/3x5pfmbsQys)&#x20;
