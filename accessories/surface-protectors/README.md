# Surface protectors

## Overview

There are many options to protect the surface of your tablet from scratches, etc. There are options for both pen tablets (screenless tablets) and pen displays (screen tablets). &#x20;

## Considerations for all tablets&#x20;

* **Protectors do not interfere with the pen** - These protective sheets do NOT interfere with how your pen works. The EMR signal from the pen, passes right through non-metallic materials such as plastic or glass. &#x20;
* **Protectors do not interfere with touch** - But check with the protector manufacturer to be sure.&#x20;

## Considerations for pen displays

* **Transparency** - Protective sheets for pen displays must, of course, be transparent. Make sure you verify any protector you buy is intended for use with a pen display.
* **Anti-glare** - you have to consider if the have an anti-glare treatment and how much anti-glare sparkle they cause. Some people are very sensitive to the amount of sparkle. So factor that into your choice. More here: [**anti-glare sparkle**](../../guides/pen-displays/anti-glare-sparkle.md).&#x20;

## Protection from the tablet manufacturer

* Built-in screen protection on pen displays - Some pen displays arrive with a protective film already on top of the screen. The purpose of this screen is to prevent glare and protect the glass.  It may be possible to replace that film. Contact your manufacturer to see if they sell replacement films. As an example: The **Huion Kamvas 13** has a protective film on top of it that can be replaced: [Huion - How to Replace Huion Pen Display Screen Protector](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B8CyIZfX8co)
