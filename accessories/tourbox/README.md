# TourBox

## Introduction

TourBox ([https://www.tourboxtech.com/](https://www.tourboxtech.com/)) makes an input device that simplifies doing artwork with a drawing tablet.

Essentially it is like a keyboard/keypad that looks like a game controller - where the buttons are completely customizable. A single key or dial can even be set do perform different functions for different applications.

[My notes on using the TourBox](7p-notes-tourbox.md)

The key benefit of this device is that instead of using the keyboard while you are drawing - which frequently, you can use the TourBox instead to perform common actions like

* zoom in / zoom out
* undo / redo
* change brush size
* switch tools
