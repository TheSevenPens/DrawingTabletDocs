# Drawing gloves

## Overview

You may notice that some tablet users wear drawing gloves. Sometimes these gloves even come inside the tablet box. Unlike  a normal glove, usually a drawing glove only covers the last two fingers and leaves your other two fingers uncovered.&#x20;

## Benefits

The gloves keep the screen free from sweat and oil from your hand.

Primarily they are worn by people using pen displays (tablets that have a screen) though they work just as well with pen tablets.&#x20;

They can also be useful in helping with palm rejection with tablets that support touch.
