# Drawing gloves

You may notice that some tablet users wear drawing gloves. Sometimes these gloves even come inside the tablet box.&#x20;

The gloves keep the screen free from sweat and oil from your hand.

Primarily they are worn by people using pen displays (tablets that have a screen) though they work just as well with pen tablets.&#x20;
