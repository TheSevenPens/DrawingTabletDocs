## Pen Displays

### Q: Why does my pen display have a sparkly grain/noise/greasy look?

To avoid the light sources from interfering with using your drawing tablet, Manufacturers apply an **anti-glare treatmen**t to drawing tablets. This anti-glare treatment disperses like from the tablet in such a way that you see it as a colorful sparkle.

### Q: Why does my pen display show an after image?

This is temporary phenomena called **Image Persistence** ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image\_persistence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image\_persistence))

This is not a permanent change and is not screen burn in ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screen\_burn-in](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screen\_burn-in)).

### Q: Can I use a pen display without plugging in the HDMI cable?

Answer: YES but it depends on the model of pen display you have. Many pen displays will work exactly like pen tablets if you don't plug in the HDMI input.

Also, leaving the HDMI cable unplugged will not damage the tablet.

### Q: How do I enable mouse mode on a pen display?

The drivers that manufacturers release for their drawing tablets support Mouse Mode often only on their pen tablets but not on pen displays.

### Q: Can I fix a dead pixel on my pen display?

It **MAY** be possible to fix. See this video: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5pvtiV3B\_nE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5pvtiV3B\_nE)

A dead pixel does occur on some small percentage of monitors and pen displays.

I have not seen it be super common on pen displays from any manufacturer. And none of my pen displays from Wacom, Huion, or XP-Pen have any dead pixels.

## General

### Q: Is it normal for pen to lag?
