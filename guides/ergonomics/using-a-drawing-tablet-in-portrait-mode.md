# Using a drawing tablet in portrait mode

By default, drawing tablets are configured for landscape orientation. However all drawing tablets can be configured to handle portrait orientation also. This applies to both pen tablets and pen displays.&#x20;

This is done via a "rotation". You will at least need to make a change in the tablet driver. And if you are using a pen display, also in the display settings of your computer's operating system. This rotation configuration instructions are here: [**Rotating a drawing tablet**](rotating-a-drawing-tablet.md)
