# Using a drawing tablet in portrait mode

Normally you tablets are configured for landscape orientation. However they can all be configured to handle portrait orientation also.

This is done via a "rotation". You will at least need to make a change in the tablet driver. And if you are using a pen display, also in the display settings of your computer's operating system.

This rotation configuration is described here: [**Rotating a drawing tablet**](rotating-a-drawing-tablet.md)
