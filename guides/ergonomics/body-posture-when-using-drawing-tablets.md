# Body posture when using drawing tablets

## **Overview**

Depending on the kind of drawing tablet you have you, you will have a very different body posture.

To quickly summarize:

* With a **pen tablet**, your back will naturally have a more vertical posture
* With a **pen display**, your will be hunched over a little or a lot.
* With a **standalone tablet**, you will also be often hunched over.

## The pen tablet posture

When using the pen tablet on a desk...

The pen tablet will be laying typically flat on the desk - so it is parallel to the desk.

Your posture will be as follows

* Your back will be vertical
* Your head will be looking straight ahead at your monitor
* Your eyes will be pointed straight ahead at your monitor
* One hand will be holding the pen on the tablet
* The other hand will usually be on the desk, often placed on or hear the keyboard to press shortcut keys

## The pen display posture

When using a pen display on a desk..

The pen display will mostly be at an angle to the desk and not flat because people:

* Tilt the tablet using legs that come with the tablet
* Tilt the tablet to varying degrees using a stand. Some tablets come with a stand and some are bought separately
* Tilt the tablet using a monitor arm

Your posture will be as follows:

* Your back will be leaning in toward the tablet
* Your head will be angles down a bit towards at the tablet screen - how much you look down depends on on the tilt you have of the tablet.
* Your eyes will be likely be looking down a little bit
* One hand will be holding the pen on the tablet
* The other hand will usually be on the desk, often placed on or hear the keyboard to press shortcut keys

## Which has better posture?

Most people report that using **a pen tablet gives them a better posture**.

Even people who prefer to use pen displays typically have to be conscious of their posture and take breaks, stretch, etc.

Be aware MANY people find the posture of a pen display to be very difficult to deal with. I've seen many people buy a pen display and the return it and switch to a pen tablet because of this reason.

For some people the posture of a pen display is VERY uncomfortablet and can cause real pain.
