# Connecting a pen tablet to a computer

## Overview

All pen tablets connect to a computer with a USB cable. Some pen tablets ALSO connect to a computer wirelessly - almost always Bluetooth.

## Basic requirements

Pen tablets, because they do not have a screen, don't draw much power and don't transmit a lot of data. So any USB 2.0 cable will work that fits the tablet and that **carries data**.&#x20;

Modern pen tablets all have a standard USB-C port flush with the edge of the tablet.&#x20;

Older pen tablets may use micro-USB ports. Some even older tablets, have the cable permanently affixed to the tablet. An example is the Wacom Intuos 4 XL.

## Manufacturer cables vs 3rd party cables

Generally for pen tablets, I recommend using the cables that the manufacturer provides. But sometimes these get lost or damaged. Even though I never use those cables myself, I always use 3rd party cables.  &#x20;

If you use a 3rd party cable you have to make sure the cable can do 2 things:

* Can carry power
* Can carry data - not all USB-C cables carry data. For example, some USB-C cables are power only.&#x20;

Can you use the cable that you use for other devices? Yes, as long as it can carry power and data.&#x20;

## The 3rd part cables I use for pen tablets

I use USB 2.0 cables with a USB-C plug on one end (this goes to the tablet) and a USB-A end on the other (this goes to the computer or to a USB-hub).

The specific cables I use are these:

And I use these cables with many other devices that only need USB 2.0 connectivity.

I specifically choose the blue color so that I can visually identify it is a USB 2.0 cable.&#x20;

## Using adapters for USB port types

These days the ports on pen tablets are all USB C ports. However older tablets used different kinds of ports. These could be micro USB or mini USB. And cables that have micro USB ends or mini USB ends are getting more difficult to find. For this reason I prefer to continue to use USB C cables but use adapters for these older tablets if possible.
