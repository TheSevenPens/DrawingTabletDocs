# Connecting a pen tablet to a computer

## Overview

All pen tablets connect to a computer with a USB cable. Some pen tablets ALSO connect to a computer wirelessly - almost always Bluetooth.

## Basic requirements

Pen tablets, because they do not have a screen, don't draw much power and don't transmit a lot of data. So any USB 2.0 cable will work that fits the tablet and that **carries data**.&#x20;

Modern pen tablets all have a standard USB-C port flush with the edge of the tablet.&#x20;

Older pen tablets may use micro-USB ports. Some even older tablets, have the cable permanently affixed to the tablet. An example is the Wacom Intuos 4 XL.

## Manufacturer cables vs 3rd party cables

Generally for pen tablets, I recommend using the cables that the manufacturer provides. But sometimes these get lost or damaged. Even though I never use those cables myself, I always use 3rd party cables.  &#x20;

If you use a 3rd party cable you have to make sure the cable can do 2 things:

* Can carry power
* Can carry data - not all USB-C cables carry data. For example, some USB-C cables are power only.&#x20;

Can you use the cable that you use for other devices? Yes, as long as it can carry power and data.&#x20;

## The 3rd part cables I use for pen tablets

I use USB 2.0 cables with a USB-C plug on one end (this goes to the tablet) and a USB-A end on the other (this goes to the computer or to a USB-hub).

The specific cables I use are these:

And I use these cables with many other devices that only need USB 2.0 connectivity.

I specifically choose the blue color so that I can visually identify it is a USB 2.0 cable.&#x20;
