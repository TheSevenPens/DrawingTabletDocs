# Connecting a pen tablet to a mobile device

## Overview

I don't have much experience with using a pen tablet (screenless tablet) with mobile device like a phone, so for now I am collecting links that may help.

If you are interested in connecting a pen display (screen tablet), then go here: [**Connecting a pen display to a mobile device**](connecting-a-pen-display-to-a-mobile-device.md).

If you are interested in using your tablet with an iPhone or iPad go here: [**Using a drawing tablet with an iPad or iPhone**](../general/using-a-drawing-tablet-with-an-ipad-or-iphone.md).
