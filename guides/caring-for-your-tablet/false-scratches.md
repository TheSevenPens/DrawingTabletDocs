# False scratches

## Overview

Sometimes you may encounter something that looks like a scratch on a tablet. But it is what I call a "false scratch" or a "temporary scratch". I use these terms because, these kinds of "scratches" can be removed by cleaning the tablet or even rubbing the it away with your finger.

## Cause

These marks are caused by the pen displacing material on the surface. This material can include includes:

* Oil from your skin
* Dust and other grime
* Tiny bits of the nib that have worn away.
