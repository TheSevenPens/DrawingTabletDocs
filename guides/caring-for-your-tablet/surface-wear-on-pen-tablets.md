# Surface wear on pen tablets

## Overview of surface wear on pen tablets

All pen tablets (those without a screen) will experience some form of wear. The amount and type of wear will be affected by

* The material of the surface
* The texture of the surface
* The material of the nib
* How you draw
* Other sources of damage not related to normal use of the pen tablet

In general, surface wear is not a problem, unless it interferes with your pen. Typically this means a deep scratch which deflects the tip of the pen. This deflection may be strong enough that you will get little "bumps" if you try to draw a line across the scratch.

## Types of surface wear

* **Texture erosion** - where the surface texture starts getting a little smoother as you continue to move your pen over it. More here: [**Texture erosion on pen tablets**](surface-wear-on-pen-tablets-1.md).
* False scratches
* Scratches

## Things that look like scratches but aren't

False scratches are things that look like scratches but are really the result of a tablet surface that isn't clean. More here: [**False scratches**](false-scratches.md) &#x20;

## Scratches

Scratches are a form of permanent damage. Depending on how deep the scratch is, it can affect your drawing experience.

Below is an example of some scratches that while ugly, do not interfere with the drawing experience.

Small scratches are also hard to see sometime and greatly affected by the lighting conditions.

As you can see the scratches can be very small. These kinds of scratches will not affect your drawing experience.

Deeper and larger scratches are also possible. This can definitely affect your drawing experience.

## Extreme damage

Dropping sharp objects onto the surface of a pen tablet can result in big changes. The crater below was formed by an accidental dropping of scissors from a height of about 6" above the pen tablet.&#x20;

## Protecting the surface

There are options to help protect the surface

* Maintain your pen nibs so that they don't develop a flat edge
* Use a felt nib which is softer than a plastic nib.
* Don't press down so hard on the tablet
* Use [**surface protectors**](../../accessories/surface-protectors/)&#x20;
* When traveling with the tablet, make sure you put it inside something to prevent something from scratching the surface
