# Removing the nib from a pen

## Using a nib remover

## Alternatives to nib removers

**If don't have a nib remover**, it's not a problem you can use any instrument that can pinch the nib. Here are some options:

* Tweezers
* Needle-nose pliers
* Fingernail clippers

## Broken nib stuck in pen

If the nib is broken in half and stuck deeply inside or there's not enough of it to grip then there are some other options.&#x20;

* A little bit of hot glue at the end of a toothpick
* Stick a heated needle into the nib and when the plastic of nib cools, pull it out. Some people suggest combining this technique with glue on the needle tip. <mark style="color:red;">**Use this option with great caution. People have ruined their pens and made the problem worse with this hot needle technique.**</mark>
