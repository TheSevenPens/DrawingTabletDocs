Nibs are typically made of plastic or felt.

**Surface texture** - Drawing with plastic nib feels smoother. Felt adds a little extra sensation of texture

**Nib wear** - Felt nibs will wear down more than plastic nibs.

**Impact damage** - I've dropped pens with felt nibs and found that a drop is more likely to affect damage the felt nib.&#x20;
