# Nib material

## Overview

The nibs of drawing tablet pens can be made of different materials. The most common nib material is plastic or felt. The vast majority of pens, by default, have a plastic nib pre-installed. Though I know of at least one case where a pen has a felt nib preinstalled (The Huion PW600 and PW600S). The numerical can greatly affect the drawing experience.

## Effects of nib material

**Surface texture** - Drawing with plastic nib feels smoother. Felt adds a little extra sensation of texture

**Nib wear** - Felt nibs will wear down more than plastic nibs.

**Impact damage** - I've dropped pens with felt nibs and found that a drop is more likely to affect damage the felt nib.&#x20;

Wacom offers three materials for some of their tablets such as the Wacom One:
