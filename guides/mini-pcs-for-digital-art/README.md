# Mini-PCs for digital art

## Overview

Mini-PCs (sometimes called "small form factor PCS") are relatively small PCs that these days can be competing alternatives to full-size desktop PCs.

Mini-PCs can cost much less than similarly equipped laptops and offer even more power. While they tend not to be as powerful as desktop PCs for digital art they are more than sufficient.

These Mini-PCs typically use laptop component to deliver a compact and low-power-draw experience.&#x20;
