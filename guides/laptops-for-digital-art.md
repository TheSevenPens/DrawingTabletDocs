# Laptops for digital art

## Recommended specs

These are based my experience doing on doing 2D illustration using Krita and Clip Studio Paint.

* **Memory**
  * NOT ENOUGH: 4GB
  * OK: 8GB
  * GOOD: 16GB
  * EXCELLENT: 32GB
* **I/O Ports**
  * If you want to connect a modern pen display with a USB-C cable should have a USB-C port that supports DP-Alt mode and that is available for use to connect with your pen display.&#x20;
    * All Thunderbolt 3 and Thunderbolt 4 ports support DP alt mode.
    * Remember: Your USB-C cable ALSO needs to support DP alt mode.

## Connecting to a pen display

Before you buy a laptop, please ensure that you are clear how you intend to connect it to your pen display. More here: [Connecting a pen display](pen-displays/connecting-a-pen-display.md)&#x20;

## Notes on power consumption

* If your pen display is going to draw power from the laptop it is going to limit the time your laptop can work on battery power.
* So in these cases&#x20;
  * (1) the laptop should be connected to a power from the wall.
  * (2) or the pen display should be getting power from another source.

## Specific laptops I recommend

### Windows

* [Surface Pro 8](../product-info/microsoft/microsoft-surface-pro-8.md)&#x20;
* [Surface Pro 9](../product-info/microsoft/microsoft-surface-pro-9.md)&#x20;
* Surface Laptop Studio&#x20;
* Surface Laptop 5

### Macs

* I'm sure Macs are fine, but I only on December 2023 did I start playing with a MacBook Pro. So I haven't really used on enough to have an opinion yet. But many people have great experiences with them.

## What I use

I've been using a Surface Pro 8 with 32GB of RAM and 500GB of storage for two years now.

I connect it the Microsoft Surface Dock 2 for power and network connectivity.

I use two  Thunderbolt 3 cables from the Surface Pro 9 to connect two 4K 60Hz displays (one of those will be the a 4K pen display)&#x20;

Even though the Surface Pro can be used for drawing with it's own pen, I prefer to use attached drawing tablets.

**Connected tablets**&#x20;

Most often, I use these tablets with my Surface Pro 9:

* Wacom Intuos Pro (PTH-860)
* Wacom Cintiq Pro 27 (DTH-271)
* Wacom Cintiq Pro 16 (DTH-167)

Though I've used every kind successfully: Huion, XP-Pen, and Xencelabs.
