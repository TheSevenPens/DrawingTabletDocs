# Laptops for digital art

## **RAM**&#x20;

These RAM recommendations are based my experience doing on doing 2D illustration using Krita and Clip Studio Paint.

<table><thead><tr><th width="115">RAM</th><th>MY EVALUATION</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>4GB </td><td>NOT ENOUGH. AVOID.</td></tr><tr><td>8GB </td><td>OK. Should be fine basic 2D art. Good place to start for a beginner.</td></tr><tr><td>16GB</td><td>GOOD. The average person will be fine here and will be able to handle a decent workload.</td></tr><tr><td>32GB</td><td>EXCELLENT. </td></tr></tbody></table>

## Pen display connection

Before you buy a laptop, please ensure that you are clear how you intend to connect it to your pen display. More here: [**Connecting a pen display**](connections-and-cabling/connecting-a-pen-display.md)&#x20;

I recommend that you get a laptop with at least 1 USB-C port that supports DP-alt mode (any thunderbolt 3 or thunderbolt 4 port will so). Ideally, a laptop should have two such ports. See: [**USB-C DisplayPort alt mode**](pen-displays/usb-c-displayport-alt-mode.md)

If you want to connect to a pen display with a single USB-C cable, you should really this document to ensure you understand the requirements for ports and cables: [**Connecting a pen display with a single USB-C cable**](connections-and-cabling/connecting-a-pen-display-with-one-usb-c-cable.md).

## Power consumption

Pen tablets don't draw much power at all from a laptop, so it won't diminish your battery time.

Pen displays on the other hand draw a lot of power and if your laptop is powering your pen display, then it is going to limit the time your laptop can work on battery power.

For a pen display, you should either

* Keep the laptop connected to power from the wall.&#x20;
* Or, connect the pen display to get power from another source.

## Simultaneous monitors supported

If you are getting as pen display it essential willa ct as another monitor.

So you should verify your laptop can handle that many monitors.

* Some laptops for example can only handle two displays: their built in display and external monitor.
* Some laptops can handle 3 displays simultaneously
* And a few laptops can handle 4

### Laptops I do NOT recommend

#### Windows ARM laptops (FOR NOW)

<mark style="color:red;">**IMPORTANT: DO NOT get a Surface Pro that uses an ARM processor (example: Microsoft Surface Pro 11).**</mark> ARM-based Windows machines do not work with drawing tablets at the moment. More here: [Windows on ARM](windows/windows-on-arm.md).

#### **Chromebooks**

I don't recommend Chromebooks for use with drawing tablets. I don't think drawing tablets work well with Chromebooks. More here: [**Using a drawing tablet with a Chromebook**](general/using-a-drawing-tablet-with-a-chromebook.md).
