# Laptops for digital art

## What I use

I've been using a Surface Pro 8 with 32GB of RAM and 500GB of storage for two years now.

I connect it the Microsoft Surface Dock 2. And use two Thunderbolt 3 cables to the Surface Pro 9 to two 4K 60Hz monitors.&#x20;

Even though it can be used for drawing with it's own pen, I prefer to use attached drawing tablets. Specifically these are the Wacom Intuos Pro PTH-860 and Wacom Cintiq Pro 27.
