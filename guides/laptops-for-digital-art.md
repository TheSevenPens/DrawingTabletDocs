# Laptops for digital art

## What I use

I've been using a Surface Pro 8 with 32GB of RAM and 500GB of storage for two years now.

I connect it the Microsoft Surface Dock 2 for power and network connectivity.

I use 2 Thunderbolt 3 cables from the Surface Pro 9 to connec two 4K 60Hz displays (one of those will be the a 4K pen display)&#x20;

Even though the Surface Pro can be used for drawing with it's own pen, I prefer to use attached drawing tablets.

Specifically I use these tablets with my Surface Pro 9:

* Wacom Intuos Pro (PTH-860)
* Wacom Cintiq Pro 27 (DTH-271)
* Wacom Cintiq Pro 16 (DTH-167)

## Recommended specs

These are based my experience doing on doing 2D illustration using Krita and Clip Studio Paint.

* Memory
  * OK-ish: 8GB
  * GOOD: 16GB
  * EXCELLENT: 32GB
* Ports
  * If you want to connect a modern pen display your laptop should have a USB-C port that supports DP-Alt mode and that is available for use to connect with your pen display.&#x20;
    * All Thunderbolt 3 and Thunderbolt 4 ports support DP alt mode.&#x20;

## Notes on power consumption

* If your pen display is going to draw power from the laptop it is going to limit the time your laptop can work on battery power.
* So in these cases&#x20;
  * (1) the laptop should be connected to a power from the wall.
  * (2) or the pen display should be getting power from another source.
