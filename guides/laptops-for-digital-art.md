# Laptops for digital art

## **RAM**&#x20;

These RAM recommendations are based my experience doing on doing 2D illustration using Krita and Clip Studio Paint.



<table><thead><tr><th width="115">RAM</th><th>MY TAKE</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>4GB </td><td>NOT ENOUGH. AVOID.</td></tr><tr><td>8GB </td><td>OK-idh</td></tr><tr><td>16GB</td><td>GOOD - the average person will be fine here</td></tr><tr><td>32GB</td><td>EXCELLENT</td></tr></tbody></table>

## Pen display connection

Before you buy a laptop, please ensure that you are clear how you intend to connect it to your pen display. More here: [**Connecting a pen display**](connections-and-cabling/connecting-a-pen-display.md)&#x20;

I recommend that you get a laptop with at least 1 USB-C port that supports DP-alt mode (any thunderbolt 3 or thunderbolt 4 port will so). Ideally, a laptop should have two such ports. See: [**USB-C DisplayPort alt mode**](pen-displays/usb-c-displayport-alt-mode.md)

If you want to connect to a pen display with a single USB-C cable, you should really this document to ensure you understand the requirements for ports and cables: [**Connecting a pen display with a single USB-C cable**](connections-and-cabling/connecting-a-pen-display-with-one-usb-c-cable.md).

## Power consumption

Pen tablets don't draw much power at all from a laptop, so it won't diminish your battery time.

Pen displays on the other hand draw a lot of power and if your laptop is powering your pen display, then it is going to limit the time your laptop can work on battery power.

For a pen display, you should either

* Keep the laptop connected to power from the wall.&#x20;
* Or, connect the pen display to get power from another source

## Specific laptops I recommend

### Windows

* [Surface Pro 8, 9, and 10](../product-info/microsoft/microsoft-surface-pro-9.md) (**but NOT 11** - see the note on Windows on ARM Below)&#x20;
* Surface Laptop Studio&#x20;
* Surface Laptop 5 & 6 (**not NOT 7** - see the note on Windows on ARM Below)&#x20;
* Samsung Galaxy Book3 Pro 360&#x20;
* Samsung Galaxy Book4 Pro 360 &#x20;

### Important note on Windows on ARM laptops

<mark style="color:red;">**IMPORTANT: DO NOT get a Surface Pro that uses an ARM processor (example: Microsoft Surface Pro 11).**</mark> ARM-based Windows machines do not work with drawing tablets at the moment. More here: [Windows on ARM](windows/windows-on-arm.md).

### Macs

* 2023 M3 MacBook Pro

### **Chromebooks**

I don't recommend Chromebooks for use with drawing tablets. I don't think drawing tablets work well with Chromebooks. More here: [**Using a drawing tablet with a Chromebook**](general/using-a-drawing-tablet-with-a-chromebook.md).

## What I use

### Microsoft Surface Pro 8

I've been using a Surface Pro 8 with 16GB of RAM and 500GB of storage for two years now.

I connect it the Microsoft Surface Dock 2 for power and network connectivity.

I use two  Thunderbolt 3 cables from the Surface Pro 8 to connect two 4K 60Hz displays (one of those will be the a 4K pen display)&#x20;

The Surface Pro can be used for drawing with its own pen. However I don't like drawing with the Surface pen. Instead,  I prefer to use attached drawing tablets.&#x20;

**Connected tablets**&#x20;

Most often, I use these tablets with my Surface Pro 9:

* Wacom Intuos Pro (PTH-860)
* Wacom Cintiq Pro 27 (DTH-271)
* Wacom Cintiq Pro 16 (DTH-167)

Though I've used every kind successfully: Huion, XP-Pen, and Xencelabs.

### 2023 M3 Macbook Pro

* Size: 14" (I wish I had purchased the 16" though)
* Chip: M3 Pro
* Memory: 36GB
* Storage: 1TB

I've used it for about 6 months as of June 2024 and my experience with it has been fantastic. I have no problems recommending it.&#x20;

It has three Thunderbolt 4 ports which is excellent.
