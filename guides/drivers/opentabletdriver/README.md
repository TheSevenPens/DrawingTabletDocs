# OpenTabletDriver

## Introduction

OpenTabletDriver (OTD)  is a third-party tablet driver. "Third-party" means it is made by someone else than the tablet manufacturer.&#x20;

At the OTD site: [**https://opentabletdriver.net/**](https://opentabletdriver.net/) you can find:

* A list of compatibles drawing tablets
* Documentation
* A link to the GitHub repo

## Why use OpenTabletDriver?

Normally, you should use your manufacturer-provided driver for your tablet. However, there are some situations where OpenTabletDriver is extremely useful or required.&#x20;

* Your manufacturer dropped support for your tablet model with their latest drivers. This may leave you stuck with a tablet you can't use.
* Your manufacturer's drivers may be malfunctioning in some way that is beyond your control to fix.
* You are trying to troubleshoot a problem and want to see if the problem is in the driver vs some other component.
