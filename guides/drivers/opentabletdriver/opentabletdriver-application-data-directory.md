# OpenTabletDriver application data directory

## Introduction

No matter where OpenTabletDriver is installed, when it is running, it will put its data into a user-specific application data folder on Windows.

The location of the folder is here in Windows: `%localappdata%\OpenTabletDriver` &#x20;

This expands to a path that should look like:

`C:\Users\username\AppData\Local\OpenTabletDriver`

This is what my folder looks like:

### ProTip: Quickly get to the AppData folder by pressing WINDOWS+R and typing appdata.

It will open a window directly to that folder.
