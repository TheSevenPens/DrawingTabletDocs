# Uninstalling manufacturer tablet drivers

First navigate to **Add/Remove programs** and uninstall your existing tablet drivers. Note that you may be required to restart your computer.

For many cases this will be enough. But if it isn't try the next step.

Even after you have uninstalled the driver, it is common for drivers to leave parts of itself still installed and these components have to be removed also.
