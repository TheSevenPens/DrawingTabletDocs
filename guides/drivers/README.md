# Drivers

For you to fully use the features of your drawing tablet you need to install drivers in your computer.

## Using a tablet without installing drivers

In **some** cases it is possible to use a tablet without drivers. More here: [Using a tablet without installing drivers](using-a-drawing-tablet-without-installing-drivers.md).&#x20;

## Driver compatibility with multiple tablets&#x20;

A specific version of a tablet driver tends to be compatible with a range of tablets from a specific manufacturer.&#x20;

For example Wacom's windows are compatible with wide range of their tablets.

Here is the [compatibility list](https://cdn.wacom.com/u/productsupport/drivers/win/professional/releasenotes/Windows\_6.4.4-3.html) for version 6.4.4-3 of the Wacom drivers.

## OpenTabletDriver

* An alternative to manufacturer-provided drivers is **OpenTabletDriver** ([https://opentabletdriver.net/](https://opentabletdriver.net/))
* If you want to try OpenTabletDriver on Windows for use with creative applications, I wrote an detailed [**OpenTabletDriver Installation guide for Windows**](opentabletdriver/opentabletdriver-windows.md).
