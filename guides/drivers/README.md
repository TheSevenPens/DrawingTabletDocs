# Drivers



## Overview

To fully use all the features of your drawing tablet, you must to install drivers in your computer.

## The importance of installing tablet drivers

Without tablet drivers you won't be able to:

* Use tilt
* Use pressure
* Configure the buttons on the pen
* Configure buttons on the tablet
* Control which display the tablet is mapped to
* Ensure that you have matching aspect ratios between your tablet and display so that you are drawing without distortion
* Control the pressure curve of the pen - though you will still be able to control it in those applications that support it.&#x20;

## Driver compatibility with multiple tablets&#x20;

A specific version of a tablet driver tends to be compatible with a range of tablets from a specific manufacturer.&#x20;

For example Wacom's windows are compatible with wide range of their tablets.

Here is the [compatibility list](https://cdn.wacom.com/u/productsupport/drivers/win/professional/releasenotes/Windows\_6.4.4-3.html) for version 6.4.4-3 of the Wacom drivers.
