# Drivers

For you to fully use the features of your drawing tablet you need to install drivers in your computer.

## Using a tablet without drivers

Windows and Macs do not have built in drivers for drawing tablets.

If you plug the tablet into a Windows or Mac, then one of two things will happen:

* (A) The drawing tablet won't work at all.&#x20;
  * Touching the pen to the tablet won't move the mouse pointer
  * The computer may not recognize that a tablet is connected
* (B) On Windows it may work in a very rudimentary way work due some basic PNP (Plug-and-Play) tablet driver support. See: [Windows PNP support for drawing tablets](windows-pnp-support-for-drawing-tablets.md).&#x20;

## OpenTabletDriver

* An alternative to manufacturer-provided drivers is **OpenTabletDriver** ([https://opentabletdriver.net/](https://opentabletdriver.net/))
* If you want to try OpenTabletDriver on Windows for use with creative applications, I wrote an detailed [**OpenTabletDriver Installation guide for Windows**](opentabletdriver/opentabletdriver-windows.md).
