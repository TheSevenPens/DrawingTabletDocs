# Pen pressure

## Pressure

Pressure is the physical force being exerted on its tip. Remember that it is the pen that measure the pressure, not the tablet surface.&#x20;

## Pressure range

* The **pressure range** is the range of physical force the pen is capable of sensing and outputting as pressure
* A wide pressure range is desirable. It contributes a lot to a good pressure experience.&#x20;
* A low minimum pressure can be just as important as a high maximum pressure.
* Pen experts I've talked to say that
  * A larger pressure range is even more important than the number of pressure levels&#x20;
  * Wacom historically is known for a wide pressure range with their pens.

## Pressure ranges compared

Tablet expert [Kuuube](../../resources/kuuube/), has independently measured the pressure ranges and many pens. Below are his measurements for several Wacom pens.

## Initial Activation Force

The **Initial Activation Force** is the minimum amount of pressure required for the pen to report that there is any pressure. In other words, it is another name for the lower bound of the pressure range

A lower Initial activation force is considered good because it allows you to draw finer details better.&#x20;

Low is subjective but here are some guidelines

* An EXCELLENT IAF would be < 1gf&#x20;
* An GOOD IAF would be 3 gf&#x20;

## IAF sensitivity

Some people REALLY need that EXCELLENT IAF of <1gf.&#x20;

Others like (myself included) work fine with a 3gf IAF. I definitely notice the difference but it doesn't effect me with the kind of art I create.

## IAF across brands

* Wacom's is known for low IAF for their pro line of pens. For example, the Wacom Pro Pen 2 seems to have an IAF of less than 1gf
* Huion's, XP-Pen, and Xencelabs have a higher IAF - their lowest seems to be around 3gf.&#x20;
* In my experience, I feel that the Huion pens I have tried (PW517) have a slightly lower IAF than the XP-Pens I have used (X3 Elite, X3 Pro Smart Chip).

## Pressure levels

These days tablet brands say that they can handle 8K (8192) levels of pressure. Some tablets even claim to support 16K pressure levels.

Don't get caught up in hype about pressure levels. I claim you only need 2048 levels of pressure (and probably even less than that). As a quick example watch this 35 second video: [https://youtu.be/V-79hS5sRQw](https://youtu.be/V-79hS5sRQw)&#x20;

## Disabling pressure

Sometimes it is useful to disable pen pressure. For options on how to do so go here: [**Disable pen pressure**](disable-pen-pressure.md).

## Notes

* Pens - even if they are of the same model - differ a little in their pressure sensitivity
* Pressure sensors are subject to wear. Over time, you may find that a pen is less sensitive to pressure than it used to be. Though in practice, I have never experienced this in any noticable way myself.

## How pressure is measured

The **modern technique** is that the nib of the pen is pressing into into a pressure sensor inside the pen. The nib in this configuration goes through the ferrite rod which is hollow like a tube and then the nib touches the pressure sensor deeper in the pen. That pressure data is then encoded back into the electromagnetic signal generated by the inductor coil which then the tablet senses and decodes.

A **very old technique** is that the nib presses against and moves a soldi ferrite rod. The movement of the rod changes the resonant frequency of the inductor coil. That change in frequency is then sensed by the tablet

With either technique, the key point is that the pressure is measured by the pen and then transmitted to the tablet.
