# Pen tracking

## Introduction

* **Pen tracking is** the tablet's interpretation of the physical position of pen. &#x20;

## Overview

* **Pen tracking accuracy** = excluding parallax and lag, this is how close the the operating system cursor (mouse pointer) is to the physical tip of the pen.
* Perfectly accurate pen tracking means the tablet things the pen is exactly where the physical tip is. Any deviation from that is an inaccuracy.
* All tablets are slightly inaccurate. Naturally it is much more obvious when a pen display is inaccurate.
*   #### Pen tracking calibration

    If your pen's position is not matching where the pointer is, [**pen tracking calibration**](../customizing-your-experience/calibrate-pen-position-on-a-pen-display.md) may help.
