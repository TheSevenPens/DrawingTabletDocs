# Active area size

## Introduction

As a rectangular region, we can discuss the size of the active area in different ways

* Width & Height
* Diagonal length
* Area&#x20;

But most often we will talk about active area sizes using the **diagonal length**.

If you need help picking the right size for your tablet, consult [**choosing the right tablet size**](choosing-the-right-tablet-size.md).

## Size in tablet names

You can often see the diagonal length in the names of pen displays. For example:

* Wacom Cintiq Pro **27**
* Huion Kamvas Pro **16** Plus 4K

For pen tablets, manufacturers often use descriptive names such as "small", "large" instead of numbers.

* Wacom Intuos Pro Medium
* Wacom Intuos Pro Large

## Standard sizes

By looking at the Wacom's product line and naming, we can establish a decent framework understanding how descriptive words like "small" and "large" map to numbers. Note that the size names are different for pen displays and pen tablets.

## Distribution of active area sizes&#x20;

If we look at how drawing tablet models are distributed along this scale we'll see that there is a lot of variation.

## Finding the width and height from the diagonal and aspect ratio

Sometimes we are given the diagonal of the active area and its aspect ratio, but not the exact height and width.

In this case it is very easy to calculate the height and width.
