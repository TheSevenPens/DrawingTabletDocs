# Lag

## Overview

Unlike a pen and paper system, where there is essentially an instantaneous feeling to drawing, a drawing tablet being a digital system where many components are processing and communicating data is always subject to some form of lag.

In the context of drawing tablets, I use the word log to describe how things are "following" the physical pen.

There are two kinds of lag&#x20;

* [**Pointer lag**](lag-1.md)
* [**Brush lag**](lag-2.md) &#x20;
