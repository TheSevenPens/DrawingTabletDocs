# Lag

## Introduction

Unlike a pen and paper system, where there is essentially an instantaneous feeling to drawing, a drawing tablet being a digital system where many components are processing and communicating data is always subject to some form of lag.

In the context of drawing tablets, I use the word log to describe how things are "following" the physical pen.&#x20;
