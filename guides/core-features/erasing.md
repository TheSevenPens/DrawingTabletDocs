# Erasing

## Overview

Besides drawing, pens have varying support for specifically erasing things. Typically this is done either with an eraser on the pen or using the pen buttons to perform the erasing.

## Pens with erasers

**Some** EMR pens have an eraser at the other end of the nib. This eraser is essentially just a thicker nib.

## App support for erasers

Drawing apps have to know what to do with the eraser, and not all make use of the eraser function.

Remember that a specific tablet is compatible with only specific pens. Avoid buying a pen that has an eraser and assuming it will work with your tablet. Always check with the manufacturer.

## Using the side buttons to erase

Another option is to map the side buttons to switch to the eraser tool in the app you are using. You can do this in the tablet driver app.
