# Active area aspect ratio

## Introduction

The aspect ratio of your drawing tablet's [**active area**](active-area.md), can have a big impact on how good it feels to draw on them.

## Basics

Any rectangular area has an aspect ratio. Which is the relationship between the width and height. Usually we will express the AR as a ratio like 16:9 or 16x9.&#x20;

Displays (monitors) tend to have aspect ratios like 16x9 and 16x10. 16x9 is the most common aspect ratio.

## Aspect ratio mismatches with pen tablets (IMPORTANT)

If you are using a pen tablet, it mostly likely does not match the aspect ratio of your monitor and you will see some distortion when you draw.&#x20;

This will make give you a weird and unpleasant feeling while drawing. You can fix this by forcing the aspect ratios to match. More here: [Matching aspect ratios](../customizing-your-experience/matching-aspect-ratios.md).

## Pen displays and aspect ratios

The active area of a pen display and their display panel inside the pen display are equivalent. So they always match.

## Reference

### A survey of aspect ratios of Wacom pen tablets

As of 2023, NONE of Wacom's pen tablets have an exact 16:9 aspect ratio.
