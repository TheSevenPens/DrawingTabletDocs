# Pen barrel rotation

## Introduction

Barrel rotation is very easy to understand. It's just a rotation of the pen along its long axis.

In the diagram below, the pen is oriented perpendicular to the tablet and you can see the shadow cast on the tablet is directly under the pen. This means the pen has no tilt.

**Barrel rotation** is indicated by the  arrows and the long axis of the pen by the dotted line.&#x20;

## Availability

Barrel rotation is a **very rare feature** on pens. As far as I know, only Wacom has ever had supported feature in their pens.  The two Wacom pens that support barrel rotation are:

* KP-701E
* ZP-600

Keep in mind these pens only work with specific Wacom tablets.
