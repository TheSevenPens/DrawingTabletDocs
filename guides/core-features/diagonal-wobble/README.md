# Diagonal wobble

## **Overview**

Diagonal wobble is a regular displacement of the tablet's interpretation of the pen's position.&#x20;

You might also see this referred to as: "jitter"

## Companion video

I covered wobble extensively in this video on pen display accuracy ([https://youtu.be/M4rEk\_RNBrM](https://youtu.be/M4rEk\_RNBrM))

## What it looks like (exaggerated)

If you slowly draw line on a tablet WITH A RULER the wobble will be apparent on diagonal lines.

## Characteristics

* The wobble can happen with any kind of pen movement - straight lines, or curves.&#x20;
* As the name suggest, the wobble is apparent with the pen is moving at an angle.
  * A 45 deg angle exhibits the most wobble
  * A 0 deg or 90 deg angle exhibits no wobble.
  * Angles between 0 and 90 exhibit more wobble as they approach 45 degrees.&#x20;
* The wobble is just more obvious with straight lines even the the same amount of wobble occurs with curves
* Generally the wobble will be present the slower the pen is travelling
* Some tablets exhibit the wobble even when moving the pen fast. This is less common.

## Prevalence

* Diagonal wobble is present in all drawing tablets in varying amounts.&#x20;
* There's no clear pattern by price or by brand or by device type about when wobble appears.

## Causes

* The wobble is NOT due to the nib wobbling in the pen.&#x20;
  * The nib can be perfectly fixed in the pen and you would still observe the wobble.
  * In any case, remember that the nib is not what the tablet senses to detect position, but rather the inductor coil deeper inside the pen.&#x20;
* The wobble comes from the tablet and how it senses the pen position.
* The wobble is due to how the tablet senses and interpolates the pens position.
* The wobble is present in multiple digital pen technologies
  * The wobble is present with EMR pens
  * The wobble is present with non-EMR pen technologies such as MPP, AES, and the Apple pencil.

## Diagonal Wobble samples

These examples were created by creating a 4K image in Krita and drawing (roughly) a 10cm line over 3 seconds using a smooth plastic ruler.

## Diagonal wobble in XP-Pen&#x20;

Some recent models with XP-Pen feature some excessive [**diagonal wobble**](./). This is something you should check into when looking into these models.

Here are examples of of the line wobble in recent XP-Pen
