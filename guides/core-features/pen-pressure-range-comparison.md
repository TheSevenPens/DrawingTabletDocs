# Pen pressure range comparison

## Overview

Based on my analysis of pen pressure ranges, I have developed this simple rating scale for IAF and max pressure. This represents my initial thinking and I expect to revise this in the future based on feedback.

For more general information about pen pressure go here: [**pen pressure**](pen-pressure.md)

## **Keep in mind**

* Pens, even of the same model, vary in how their pressure handling
* Drivers can potentially affect IAF.&#x20;

## Pressure measurements

The collected measurements for pen pressure can be found here: [https://1drv.ms/x/s!Aml8i4Jd6crCkTerfXD\_1zsIxg3A?e=2aCPfI](https://1drv.ms/x/s!Aml8i4Jd6crCkTerfXD\_1zsIxg3A?e=2aCPfI)&#x20;

It combines data from:

* Manufacturers
* From tablet experts such as Kuuube
* And my own measurements
