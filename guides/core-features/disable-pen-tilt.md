# Disable pen tilt

## Overview

Pen tilt information is always sent from the tablet to the tablet driver and from there to the operating system and then to pen-aware applications.

Sometimes when drawing it can be useful to turn off tilt. There are options

## **OPTION 1 Use brush settings**

Drawing apps that use brushes may let you control how tilt affects the brush. So, you can configure specific brushes to ignore tilt. Examples of applications that support this are Clip Studio Paint and Krita.

## **OPTION 2 Turn tilt off in the driver**

Turn off tilt in the driver - SOME tablet drivers let you simply turn off tilt so that it isn't reported to your operating system or applications.

XP-Pen drivers have this feature.
