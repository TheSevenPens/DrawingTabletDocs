# Bezel

The bezel of a drawing tablet is essentially all the area on the surface of the drawing tablet that is not the [active area](active-area.md).

For many devices such a phones and TVs, people make a big deal about having the smallest bezels possible. For drawing tablets, it is good to have a wide bezel.

## Ergonomic benefits

* Avoids your pen uncomfortably "dropping off" if you are making strokes near the edge of the active area
* Provides a place for you rest your wrist or forearm so that the edge of the tablet is not digging into them. &#x20;

## Drawing benefits

The EMR sensor (digitizer) needs to be a bit wider than the active area so that it is still accurate at the edges. A wider bezel provides that extra space for the digitizer.
