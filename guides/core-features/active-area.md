# Active area

## Introduction

The **active area** of a drawing tablet is the rectangle region of the tablet's surface that detects the EMR pen. Some drawing tablet manufacturers (Wacom & XP-pen) use the term **active area** while others (Huion) use the term **working area**.

When we talk about the "size" of the drawing tablet, we are referring to the active area.

## Active area of pen tablets

The active area of a pen tablet is usually designated by marks on the surface. Sometimes it is marked at its four corners. Some tablets show a grid of of dots.

## Active area of pen displays

The active area of a pen display is very easy to detect because it is the exact the same area of the display panel.

## Size

Usually when we discuss the size of an active area, we talk about its diagonal length. Drawing tablets vary quite a bit in their active area size. More here: [**Active area size**](active-area-size.md).

## Aspect ratio

The relationship between the width and height of the active area is its aspect ratio. More here: [**Active area aspect ratio**](active-area-aspect-ratio.md).
