# Choosing the right tablet size

## Size = Active Area Size

The way we measure a tablets size is NOT the physical size of the device. Instead we measure the diagonal of the ACTIVE AREA of the tablet. The ACTIVE AREA is the region on the surface of the tablet that is responsive to the tablet's EMR pen.

Learn more about the active area here:

## Size categories

I've given convenient labels ("small", "medium", "large") to drawing tablets. This will make it easier to talk about their sizes. The sizes here are approximate.

<table><thead><tr><th width="188">Size category</th><th width="170.33333333333331">Pen tablet</th><th width="249.66666666666669">Pen display</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>SMALL</td><td>7"</td><td>13"</td></tr><tr><td>MEDIUM</td><td>11"</td><td>16"</td></tr><tr><td>LARGE</td><td>15"</td><td>24"</td></tr><tr><td>EXTRA LARGE</td><td>23"</td><td>32"</td></tr></tbody></table>

## Considerations

Here's what you should consider in your choice

* What is your natural drawing style? some people draw a lot from the wrist and others use much larger motions driven from their elbows and shoulders
* Do you have enough space on your desk?
* Do you intend to be mobile and use the tablet in different locations?

## **Small pen tablets (7")**

**Small** pen tablets are good for scenarios where the focus is less on creating strokes. For example, if you need to simply use a tablet as a replacement for a mouse, then a small tablet will work fine. One creative task that works great with small tablets in photo editing - since it doesn't typically require "drawing".&#x20;

Most people who are drawing would find using a small tablet, to feel very "cramped".

## Medium pen tablets (11")

**Medium** pen tablets are the best combination of size, cost, and ergonomics for most people interested in drawing tablets and is my standard recommendation.

medium tablets are the minimum size I would recommend for anyone who is interested in drawing, sketching, painting, or any creative task that requires drawing with strokes.

## Large pen tablets (15")

In general I advise against getting a LARGE pen tablet unless you already have experience using one or are highly confident your art style will benefit from it and you are ready to deal with the ergonomic issues that come from using one.

## Extra large pen tablets (23")

* Are very specialized and not appropriate for most people
* Are no longer in production -  only Wacom made them and the most recent models series - the Wacom Intuos 4 XL is from 2011.
* Require lots of adjustment to your work style due to their size

## Matching pen tablet size to monitor size

There is a relationship between the size of a pen tablet and the size of your monitor that you should pay attention to. They both have different sizes and certain combinations may work better than others.

My general guidance works out like this:

| Pen tablet Size Catgogory | Monitor Size |
| ------------------------- | ------------ |
| Extra Large (23")         | 40" - 50"    |
| Large (15")               | 30" - 40"    |
| Medium (11")              | 20" - 30"    |
| Small (7")                | 20" - 25"    |

This table is based on my preferences - you might find you find that difference combinations work better.

This video helps explain the thinking behind it:

## Pen display size

* **SMALL (13")** pen displays may be good choices for children.
* If you are drawing the minimum size I would recommend is **MEDIUM (16")**, though many people work very effectively with SMALL pen displays.&#x20;
* I think the best balance is around 20" to 22" - these provide enough space to draw on without being to cumbersome, occupying too much space on a desk, or being difficult to move.
* **LARGE (24")** are great but they do occupy a lot of space so ensure you have a desk that is big enough.
* **Anti-glare sparkle** - For a given anti-glare treatment, the higher the pixels-per-inch of the display, the more anti-glare sparkle you will notice. For example using the same anti-glare treatment a 4K 24" display will show less AG sparkle, than a 4K 16" display.&#x20;
