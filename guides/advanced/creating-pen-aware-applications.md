# Creating pen-aware applications

## **Windows**&#x20;

* **WinTab** - [https://developer-support.wacom.com/hc/en-us/articles/12844524637975-Wintab](https://developer-support.wacom.com/hc/en-us/articles/12844524637975-Wintab) This is the older but still heavily used API. Even though the API is defined by Wacom, other graphics tablet manufacturers use this same API.
* **Windows Ink** [https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/apps/design/input/ink-walkthrough](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/apps/design/input/ink-walkthrough) This is the newer and much more sophisticated API.

## **MacOS**

* I don't have any information on MacOS drawing tablet APIs.

## Various tools and libraries
