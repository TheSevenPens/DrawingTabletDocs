# Digital pen technologies

## Overview

There are a lot of digital pen technologies out there. The key ones you should know about are:

* **Electromagnetic Resonance (EMR)** - used by all modern drawing tablets
* **Active Electrostatic (AES)** - Used by many mobile devices
* **Apple Pencil tech** - Used only by Apple devices
* **Microsoft Pen Protocol (MPP)** - Used by Microsoft surface devices
* **N-Trig** - Used by some older Microsoft surface models

## Electromagnetic Resonance (EMR)&#x20;

Wacom invented EMR tech decades ago. It's primary innovation is that the pen does not need a battery. It gets its power from the tablet itself.

See this page for an explanation of how EMR works:  [EMR technology in drawing tablets](emr-tab-tech.md).

## Active Electrostatic (AES)

Wacom invented the AES technology also. It works in a fundamentally different way than EMR.

## Apple Pencil

The Apple Pencil does not use EMR. Apple uses a proprietary protocol for their pen. It is very similar to AES.

If you are curious about what is inside an Apple pencil, see this video: [https://youtube.com/shorts/M9sArtVjRps?feature=share](https://youtube.com/shorts/M9sArtVjRps?feature=share)

## N-Trig

Was a technology used by the third, fourth generation of Microsoft Surface pens.

## Microsoft Pen Protocol (MPP)

Microsoft switched from N-Trig to their own MPP protocol. MPP is very similar to AES.
