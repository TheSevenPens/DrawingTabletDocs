# Beginner's guide to drawing tablets

You will find this guide useful if you:

* are exploring if drawing tablets are right for you
* about to buy one
* need to buy one as a gift
* acquired one but have never used one before&#x20;

This guide reflects **my opinions** on many topics.

## Planning on buying a drawing tablet?

I wrote a buying guide that should help: [**Buying a drawing tablet**](../buying-a-drawing-tablet/). That buying guide also links to my [**recommendations**](../buying-a-drawing-tablet/recommendations/).

However, I highly recommend that your **READ THIS DOCUMENT FIRST**, before looking at the buying guide and recommendations.&#x20;

## Basics

A drawing tablet is a device that lets you use a pen as an input device.

Drawing tablets come with a digital **pen** (often called a **stylus**). If you move the pen on the tablet, that action will move your operating system pointer around (a.k.a. your mouse cursor) the same way on your screen.&#x20;

A drawing tablet and its pen sense:

* The position of the pen on the tablet
* The pressure applied at the tip of the pen
* How the pen is tilted&#x20;

Pressure and tilt can be used to change how digital brushes draw things in creative applications. For example, more pressure could be translated as a darker stroke or maybe a thicker brush stroke.

## Core technology: Electromagnetic Resonance (EMR)

The fundamental technology behind drawing tablets is called Electromagnetic Resonance (EMR). One key benefit of EMR is that EMR pens don't need a battery inside, the pens get their energy just by being near the tablet. More here: [**EMR tablet technology**](advanced/emr-tab-tech.md)&#x20;

## Three types of drawing tablets&#x20;

## Pen tablets

Pen tablets are the simplest and least expensive kind of drawing tablet. They are often called: "screenless tablets" or "non-screen tablets".

Key attributes:

* They DO NOT have an embedded display
* They REQUIRE A COMPUTER to be used.
* They REQUIRE A MONITOR attached the the computer or that the computer is a laptop.

Below is an example of a pen tablet (One by Wacom, model number CTL-472) &#x20;

<img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (68).png" alt="" data-size="original">

Pen tablets vary from $40 to $500. But you can find a good or even excellent drawing experience at many price points.

The key skill required to use a pen tablet is that you must adjust to your hand drawing on one surface (the tablet) while you are looking at another surface (your monitor). Most people can adjust to this immediately or within a few days, but some people find this weird to do and for them a **pen display** or **pen computer** might be a better choice.

## Pen displays

Pen displays are drawing tablets that have a display panel. They are also called: "screen tablets", "display tablets".

Key attributes:

* They DO have an embedded display
* They REQUIRE A COMPUTER to be used.

A typical pen display looks like this

<img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (211).png" alt="" data-size="original">

A pen display may look like a laptop or an iPad. However unlike those devices you should be aware that the tablet will always have to have at least one cord coming from it that is connected to a computer.&#x20;

Pen displays need a lot more power than a pen tablet and they do not have a battery. So at least one of the cables connecting the pen display must provide enough power. Sometimes a laptop or PC can provide enough power, however, somtimes you must connect a cable to a power adaptor.

It is easiest to understand pen displays as plastic box with two separate devices inside it: (1) a pen tablet and (2) a monitor. In fact that's exactly what your computer thinks this device is.&#x20;

Even though a pen display is meant to draw on you can use it exactly like a normal monitor. Learn more here: [**Using a pen display as a monitor**](pen-displays/using-a-pen-display-as-a-monitor.md).

Pen displays range in cost from $300 to $3500.&#x20;

## Pen computers

**Pen computers** are essentially mobile pen displays with their own CPU and storage - in other words they are like laptops. You don't need them to be connected up to a separate computer to work.

![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (227).png>)

Pen computers include devices such as:

* Wacom Mobile Studio Pro
* Huion Kamvas Studio&#x20;

Pen computers can cost anywhere from $1000 to $3500.

Because pen computers have a CPU, they are running an operating system. Currently pen computers use Microsoft Windows.

Some people love using pen computers but I don't think pen computers are good choice for the vast majority of people. More here: [**I don't recommend pen computers**](../buying-a-drawing-tablet/the-case-against-pen-computers.md)**.**

## Alternatives to pen computers

There are other devices very similar to pen computers. These include:

* Apple iPad Pros that can be used with the Apple Pencil.&#x20;
* Microsoft Surface Pro&#x20;
* Samsung Galaxy Tab S8

These devices can run a variety of operating systems.

* Microsoft Windows
* Apple iOS

Even though they are not pen computers, I often talk about them when I discuss pen computers, because they share so many characteristics.&#x20;

### Apple iPads

Often when I see people describe what they want in a drawing tablet, their list of requirements sounds exactly like an iPad. Learn more about the pros and cons of using an iPad as a drawing tablet here: [**using an ipad as a drawing tablet**](../buying-a-drawing-tablet/using-an-ipad-as-a-drawing-tablet.md)

## Pen tablets vs Pen displays

Pen displays are NOT an inherently better choice than pen tablets.&#x20;

Many people try pen displays and learn they don't enjoy using them and go back to pen tablets.

## What people do with their tablets

* **Drawing -** Of course, many people use drawing tablets for drawing, sketching, painting, photo-editing etc. All the fundamental creative tasks.&#x20;
* **Gaming** - Drawing tablets are popular for some games. More here: [**Gaming with drawing tablets**](use-cases/gaming-with-a-drawing-tablet.md) &#x20;
* **Mouse replacement** - Using a drawing tablet as a simple mouse replacement. Some people find a pen more comfortable to hold than a mouse. More here: [**Using a drawing tablet instead of a mouse**](use-cases/using-a-drawing-tablet-instead-of-a-mouse.md)
* **Whiteboarding** - especially with so many online meetings and remote learning. Many people use a drawing tablet with virtual whiteboard software.
* **Educational videos** - They are popular for creating videos in the same style as "Khan Academy".
* **Document markup and review** - They are useful for going through documents and annotating them with other notes and corrections.
* **Note taking** - Especially with pen computers, students for example, take them to their classes and write down their notes digitally. More here: [**Taking notes with drawing tablets**](use-cases/taking-notes-with-drawing-tablets.md)&#x20;

## Drawing tablet brands

Wacom is THE UNDISPUTED LEADER of drawing tablets and have been for 40 years. They are the best and also the most expensive. But there are many other brands out there. You should familiarize yourself with them before you buy a drawing tablet. Learn more here: [**Drawing Tablet Brands**](../drawing-tablet-brands/)

## Core tablet features and specs

**Accurate detection of pen position** - any modern tablet does a good job with this. However, no drawing tablet is perfectly accurate. Learn more here:  [**pen tracking**](core-features/pen-tracking.md)&#x20;

**Hover** - Tablets can even detect the position of the pen when it is not touching the surface of the tablet. Usually up to a distance of 10 mm. This hover feature is very important, because it lets you see where your strokes are going to be drawn before you draw them.  And the hover feature makes it convenient to use the pen like a mouse to simply click on buttons or drag windows around, etc. All drawing tablets support hover. More here: [**Pen hover**](core-features/pen-hover.md)&#x20;

**Pen Pressure** - The pen detects how hard you are pressing on its tip. All modern pens detect about 8192 levels of pressure. But even 2048 would be enough for any creative use. Learn more here: [**Pen pressure**](core-features/pen-pressure.md).&#x20;

**Pen tilt** - useful if you intend to use a creative application where brushes respond to tilt. Learn more here: [**pen tilt**](core-features/pen-tilt.md).

**Pen buttons** - Pens usually feature two buttons. By default these buttons will act as a left mouse click and a right mouse click. Though you can figure them to do other things. More here: [**pen buttons**](pens/pen-buttons.md)&#x20;

**ExpressKeys** - These are buttons or dials on the tablet. Not all tablets have them, but many do. For some people ExpressKeys are important and they want a lot of them. Some other people never use the ExpressKeys. ExpressKeys can be configured. For example you can set them to perform actions like undo, change brush size, change zoom, etc. Learn more here: [**ExpressKeys**](core-features/expresskeys.md) &#x20;

## Active area size

The active area is the region on the tablet that your draw on. Size for a tablet is the diagonal of the active area. Most often this size is expressed as inches.

There's a lot that goes into picking the right size for you. So it's worth spending time thinking about this. To learn how to find the right size, look here: [**Choosing the right tablet size**](core-features/choosing-the-right-tablet-size.md)

## Drivers

When you connect a tablet to your computer, the computer needs to know how to use that tablet with a special app called a "tablet driver". If you do not install the driver, then the tablet will not work correctly. Installing the tablet driver requires administrator permissions on your computer.  More here: [**drivers**](beginners-guide.md#basics).

## Connecting the tablet to the computer

### Pen tablets

All pen tablets can be connected with a single USB cable.&#x20;

And many pen tablets (but not all) can be connected wirelessly - for example via Bluetooth.&#x20;

Be aware that many tablet models have wireless and non-wireless versions with slightly different names and model numbers. Be sure which one you are buying.

### Pen displays

Pen displays do NOT have any wireless options. There is always at least one cable used with a pen display.

Pen displays are more varied than pen tablets in the cabling works

Depending on the situation and model involved they can use:

* one cable (one cable for power+data+video signal)
* two cables (one for power and one for data + video signal)
* three cables (one for power, one for data, one for video signal)
* a 3-in-1 cable&#x20;
  * This is like the three cable option except that the three cables are fused together into a single USB cable at one end.

It's very important you understand how a pen display will connect to your computer before you purchase it. More here: [**connecting a pen display to a computer**](pen-displays/connecting-a-pen-display.md)&#x20;

## Applications

Any application on your computer, will treat the pen just as if you have a mouse. So, broadly speaking, **all applications are compatible with drawing tablet**.

**Pen-aware applications** know you are using a pen and take advantage of special features of the pen such as pressure, tilt, etc. Great examples of pen-aware applications are Krita and Clip Studio Paint, which are popular drawing applications.

More here: [**applications**](../applications/)&#x20;

## Touch support

Only a very small number of drawing tablets are touch sensitive. Mostly these are the Wacom Cintiq Pro line and the Wacom Intuos Pro line.

In my opinion, no drawing tablet offers a great touch experience. Some are truly terrible. Even the ones with the best touch support are NOT comparable to a laptop trackpad or an iPad which are much better.&#x20;

The very first thing I do with my tablets that support touch is disable the touch feature.

The recent Cintiq Pro 16 and 27 models from Wacom introduced in 2021 and 2022 have much better touch than older Wacom models, but it is not as good as what you would get from an iPad.

## Pen nibs

At the end of the pen that touches the tablet is a little replaceable nib. Mostly these nibs are plastic and sometimes felt.

As you move your nib over a tablet, over time it will wear down. Before it wears down too much you should replace your nib with a fresh one. Tablets come with extra nibs and some tool to help grasp the nib to remove it.&#x20;

Depending on how you draw you may wear through your nibs fast or very slowly. If you run out of spare nibs, you can always purchase more from your tablet manufacturer. They are very cheap.

it's important you don't let your nib wear down too much. For two reasons:

* If it wears down too much, you will not be able to easily remove it from your pen
* If it develops a flat edge that flat edge can have sharp corners that can damage the surface of your tablet.&#x20;

## Ergonomics

You may have strong preferences about **noise**. Generally drawing tablets are considered very quiet, and some are completely silent. More details here: [**Noise**](beginners-guide.md#noise)&#x20;

Drawing tablets are either room temperature or slightly warm depending on the kind of drawing tablet. More here: [**Heat**](ergonomics/heat.md)&#x20;

## Surface texture

If you are drawing, you might have strong preferences of what the texture of your tablet feels like. All drawing tablets have some surface texture but there is quite a bit of variation. There are even ways to achieve the texture you want. For example, many people want their tablet to have a rougher texture like paper.

Learn more here: [**Surface texture**](core-features/surface-texture.md)&#x20;

## Right-handed vs left-handed use

All drawing tablets work for people who are right-handed or left-handed. For those tablets with buttons or ports on one side, you may you find it more convenient to rotate the tablet around so that the buttons or ports are one the opposite side. This rotation. This is supported by most tablets. See: [**Rotating a drawing tablet**](ergonomics/rotating-a-drawing-tablet.md).

## Drawing with versus using a mouse

A drawing tablet uses absolute positioning and a mouse uses relative positioning. They behave very differently. More here: [**absolute versus relative positioning**](core-features/absolute-versus-relative-positioning.md).

Using the tablet driver, you can make tablet and pen work more like a mouse by using [**mouse mode**](core-features/mouse-mode.md).

## Using a drawing tablet with an iOS device

Normally you'll be connecting a pen tablet or pen displays to a computer.&#x20;

But some people want to try connecting those tablets to iPads. In general it doesn't work, but for a small number of specific combinations of tablets and apps, it does work. See more here: [Using a drawing tablet with an iOS device](general/using-a-drawing-tablet-with-an-ios-device.md).

## The typical problems people have with drawing tablets

At some point, something is going to go wrong. You should be prepared for it.

Typically here's what people encounter:

* They lose or damage their pen. Replacement pens are **expensive** - it may cost a significant portion of what you paid for the tablet.
* The pen no longer reports pressure or the pressure is stuck at 100%.
* The tablet driver starts acting oddly. Usually solved by restarting the computer and sometimes by installing an older driver.
* The tablet driver cannot detect the tablet.
* The tablet driver cannot detect the pen
* The pen display doesn't show anything
* The pen display shows a NO SIGNAL message&#x20;

I have put together a list of troubleshooting articles to help. More here [**troubleshooting**](../troubleshooting/)&#x20;
