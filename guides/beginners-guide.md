# Beginner's guide to drawing tablets

## Introduction

If you are new to drawing tablets, after reading this guide you'll understand how these devices work and be prepared to use one or to purchase one.&#x20;

Read this document first, then take a look at my guide to [**Buying a drawing tablet**](../buying-a-drawing-tablet/). It has links to  my [**recommendations**](../buying-a-drawing-tablet/recommendations/).&#x20;

## Basics

A drawing tablet is a device that lets you use a **digital pen** (also called a **stylus**) as an input device.

If you move the pen on the tablet, that action will move your operating system pointer around (a.k.a. your mouse cursor) the same way on your screen.&#x20;

A drawing tablet senses the position of the pen on the tablet, how the pen is tilted. The pen senses how much pressure is applied at the tip.

Detection of pressure and tilt are very important to creative applications. For example, more pressure could be translated as a darker stroke or a thicker brush stroke.

## Electromagnetic Resonance (EMR)

The fundamental technology behind drawing tablets is called Electromagnetic Resonance (EMR). One key benefit of EMR is that EMR pens don't need a battery inside, the pens get their energy just by being near the tablet. More here: [**EMR tablet technology**](advanced/emr-tab-tech.md)&#x20;

## Three types of drawing tablets&#x20;

### Pen tablets

Pen tablets are the simplest and least expensive kind of drawing tablet. They are often called: "screenless tablets" or "non-screen tablets".

Key attributes:

* They DO NOT have an embedded display
* They REQUIRE A COMPUTER to be used.
* They REQUIRE A MONITOR attached the the computer or that the computer is a laptop.

The key skill required to use a pen tablet is that you must adjust to your hand drawing on one surface (the tablet) while you are looking at another surface (your monitor). Most people can adjust to this immediately or within a few days, but some people find this weird to do and for them a **pen display** or **pen computer** might be a better choice.

Pen tablets cost between $40 to $500.&#x20;

### Pen displays

Pen displays are drawing tablets that have an embedded display panel. They are also called: "screen tablets", "display tablets".

Key attributes:

* They DO have an embedded display
* They REQUIRE A COMPUTER to be used.

A pen display may look like a laptop or an iPad. However unlike those devices you should be aware that the tablet will always have to have at least one cord coming from it that is connected to a computer.&#x20;

Pen displays need a lot more power than a pen tablet and they do not have a battery. So at least one of the cables connecting the pen display must provide enough power. Sometimes a laptop or PC can provide enough power, however, somtimes you must connect a cable to a power adaptor.

It is easiest to understand pen displays as plastic box with two separate devices inside it: (1) a pen tablet and (2) a monitor. In fact that's exactly what your computer thinks this device is.&#x20;

Even though a pen display is meant to draw on you can use it exactly like a normal monitor. Learn more here: [**Using a pen display as a monitor**](pen-displays/using-a-pen-display-as-a-monitor.md).

Pen displays cost between $300 to $3500.&#x20;

### Pen computers

**Pen computers** are essentially mobile pen displays with their own CPU and storage - in other words they are like laptops. You don't need them to be connected up to a separate computer to work. Because pen computers have a CPU, they are running an operating system and all current pen computers use Microsoft Windows.

These are also called "Standalone drawing tablets".

Some people love using pen computers but I don't think pen computers are good choice for the vast majority of people. I recommend other devices such as the Apple iPad. More here: [**I don't recommend pen computers**](../buying-a-drawing-tablet/the-case-against-pen-computers.md)**.**

Pen computers cost between $1000 to $3500.

## Apple iPads

Often when I see people describe what they want in a drawing tablet, it sounds exactly like an iPad. Learn more about the pros and cons of using an iPad as a drawing tablet here: [**using an ipad as a drawing tablet**](../buying-a-drawing-tablet/using-an-ipad-as-a-drawing-tablet.md)

## Pen tablets vs pen displays

Pen displays are NOT an inherently better choice than pen tablets. Many people try pen displays and learn they don't enjoy using them and go back to pen tablets. They each have strengths and weaknesses. More here: [**Pen tablets vs Pen displays**](beginners-guide.md#pen-tablets-vs-pen-displays) &#x20;

## What people do with their tablets

* **Drawing -** Of course, many people use drawing tablets for drawing, sketching, painting, photo-editing etc. All the fundamental creative tasks.&#x20;
* **Gaming** - Drawing tablets are popular for some games. More here: [**Gaming with drawing tablets**](use-cases/gaming-with-a-drawing-tablet.md) &#x20;
* **Mouse replacement** - Using a drawing tablet as a simple mouse replacement. Some people find a pen more comfortable to hold than a mouse. More here: [**Using a drawing tablet instead of a mouse**](use-cases/using-a-drawing-tablet-instead-of-a-mouse.md)
* **Whiteboarding** - especially with so many online meetings and remote learning. Many people use a drawing tablet with virtual whiteboard software.
* **Educational videos** - They are popular for creating videos in the same style as "Khan Academy".
* **Document markup and review** - They are useful for going through documents and annotating them with other notes and corrections.
* **Note taking** - Especially with pen computers, students for example, take them to their classes and write down their notes digitally. More here: [**Taking notes with drawing tablets**](use-cases/taking-notes-with-drawing-tablets.md)&#x20;

## Brands

Wacom is THE UNDISPUTED LEADER of drawing tablets and have been for 40 years. They are the best and also the most expensive. But there are many other brands out there. You should familiarize yourself with them before you buy a drawing tablet. Learn more here: [**Drawing Tablet Brands**](../drawing-tablet-brands/)

## Core features&#x20;

* **Tracking pen position** - any modern drawing tablet does a good job with this. Learn more here: [**Pen tracking**](core-features/pen-tracking.md)&#x20;
* **Hover** - Tablets detect the position of the pen even when the pen does not touch the surface of the tablet - usually up to a distance of 10 mm. All drawing tablets support hover. More here: [**Pen hover**](core-features/pen-hover.md)&#x20;
* **Pen pressure** - The pen detects how hard you are pressing on its tip. All modern pens detect about 8192 levels of pressure. But even 2048 would be enough for any creative use. Learn more here: [**Pen pressure**](core-features/pen-pressure.md).&#x20;
* **Pen tilt** - Pen tilt is useful if you work with a creative application with brushes respond to tilt. Learn more here: [**pen tilt**](core-features/pen-tilt.md).
* **Pen buttons** - Pens usually feature two buttons. By default these buttons will act as a left mouse click and a right mouse click. You can configure the buttons to perform other actions. More here: [**pen buttons**](pens/pen-buttons.md)&#x20;
* **ExpressKeys** - These are buttons or dials on the tablet. Not all tablets have them, but many do. You can configure express keys to perform actions like undo, change brush size, change zoom, etc. Learn more here: [**ExpressKeys**](core-features/expresskeys.md) &#x20;
* **Touch** - A small number of tablets support touch. In summary, touch for tablets has never come close to how well it works with the iPad. More here: [touch support](touch-support.md)&#x20;

More here: [Touch support](touch-support.md)&#x20;

## The active area

The active area is the region on the tablet that your draw on. More here: [active area](core-features/active-area.md).

## Size (of the active area)

When we talk about the "size" of a drawing tablet - we are referring to the size of the active area. Different people have different needs for size. To learn how to find the right size, look here: [**Choosing the right tablet size**](core-features/choosing-the-right-tablet-size.md)

## Drivers

When you connect a tablet to your computer, the computer needs to know how to use that tablet with a special app called a "tablet driver". If you do not install the driver, then the tablet will not work correctly. Installing the tablet driver requires administrator permissions on your computer.  More here: [**drivers**](beginners-guide.md#basics).

## Connecting the tablet to the computer

All **pen tablets** can be connected with a single USB cable. Many pen tablets (but not all) can be connected wirelessly - for example via Bluetooth.&#x20;

**Pen displays** do NOT have any wireless options. There is always at least one cable used with a pen display. Pen displays are more varied than pen tablets in how the cabling works. In truth, connecting a pen display can be very complicated. It's very important you understand how a pen display will connect to your computer before you purchase a pen display. More here: [**connecting a pen display to a computer**](pen-displays/connecting-a-pen-display.md)&#x20;

## Applications

Any application on your computer, will treat the pen just as if you have a mouse. So, broadly speaking, **all applications are compatible with drawing tablet**.

**Pen-aware applications** know you are using a pen and take advantage of special features of the pen such as pressure, tilt, etc. Great examples of pen-aware applications are Krita and Clip Studio Paint, which are popular drawing applications.

More here: [**applications**](../applications/)&#x20;

## Pen nibs

At the end of the pen that touches the tablet is a little replaceable nib. Mostly these nibs are plastic and sometimes felt. Nibs wear down over time. Fast fast it wears down depends on a lot of factors. If it wears down too much, it might scratch the tablets. So, before it wears down too much you should replace your nib with a fresh one. More here: [**nib wear**](caring-for-your-tablet/nib-wear.md)  &#x20;

## Ergonomics

You may have strong preferences about **noise**. Generally drawing tablets are considered very quiet, and some are completely silent. More details here: [**Noise**](beginners-guide.md#noise)&#x20;

Drawing tablets are either room temperature or slightly warm depending on the kind of drawing tablet. More here: [**Heat**](ergonomics/heat.md)&#x20;

## Drawing with a tablet vs a mouse

A drawing tablet uses absolute positioning and a mouse uses relative positioning. They behave very differently. More here: [**absolute versus relative positioning**](core-features/absolute-versus-relative-positioning.md).

Using the tablet driver, you can make tablet and pen work more like a mouse by using [**mouse mode**](core-features/mouse-mode.md).

## Using a drawing tablet with an iOS device

Normally you'll be connecting a pen tablet or pen displays to a computer. But some people want to try connecting those tablets to iPads. In general it doesn't work, but for a small number of specific combinations of tablets and apps, it does work. See more here: [Using a drawing tablet with an iOS device](general/using-a-drawing-tablet-with-an-ios-device.md).

## The typical problems people have with drawing tablets

At some point, something is going to go wrong. You should be prepared for it.
