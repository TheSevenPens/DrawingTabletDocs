# The history of Windows Ink

## Background

Windows Ink is the evolution of the pen/stylus capabilities that started appearing in Windows in the early 2000s. This was an era when Microsoft was focusing on building products around a **Tablet PC** concept - what we might call a **pen computer** today. And as a tablet, it was thought that using a pen with these devices would be critical for tasks such as note taking, marking up documents, electronic signatures, etc.

And this support is extended not only to computers that have a screen that can be used with a pen, but also tablet devices that attach to computers such as pen tablets pen displays.

## Adoption

This has been a bit of a rough journey in Windows.

When the first tablet PC features appeared though could easily interfere with drawing tablets.

But if was easy to disable those tablet PC features.

As Windows evolved. The ability to disable Tablet PC features was then hidden. And people were forced to edit registry keys.

Eventually Windows stopped listening to the registry keys.

At one point (Windows 8) it was essentially not possible to correctly use a drawing tablet with Windows.&#x20;

Eventually tablet drivers started offering a checkbox to disable the use of Windows Ink features and then we could all draw again.

At this point many apps, only used WINTAB, so many people just disabled Windows Ink entirely on their computer.

Over time, we have seen two things happen:

* Some apps ONLY work with Windows Ink
* Some apps work with BOTH Windows Ink and WINTAB
* Most modern apps handle Windows Ink

So these days the best option is to ENABLE Windows Ink in the driver, but disable it for specific apps using the driver's app-specific settings.
