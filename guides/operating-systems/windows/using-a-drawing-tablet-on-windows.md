# Using a drawing tablet on Windows

### Summary

Drawing tablets have excellent compatibility with any Windows computer.

## Drivers

Even though windows has built-in drivers for drawing tablets, they are very primitive and you should always install the manufacturer-provided tablet drivers.&#x20;

### Windows: 32-bit vs 64-bit&#x20;

If you have a 32-bit Windows computer, you should verify whether the tablet driver works on those systems by contacting their support. Some tablet manufacturers have dropped support in their drivers for those 32-bit Windows systems. This means that you might be forced to use older drivers.
