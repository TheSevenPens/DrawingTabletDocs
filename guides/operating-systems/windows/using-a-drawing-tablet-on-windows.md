# Using a drawing tablet on Windows

## Summary

Drawing tablets have excellent compatibility with any Windows computer.

## Drivers

### Manufacturer tablet drivers versus Windows PNP tablet driver

Even though windows has a built-in PNP driver for drawing tablets, they are very primitive and you should always install the manufacturer-provided tablet drivers.

### Only install one tablet driver

I don't recommend installing two different tablet drivers. In my experience they can interfere with each other. For example do not install a Huion driver AND a Wacom driver.

### Windows: 32-bit vs 64-bit&#x20;

If you have a 32-bit Windows computer, you should verify whether the tablet driver works on those systems by contacting their support. Some tablet manufacturers have dropped support in their drivers for those 32-bit Windows systems. This means that you might be forced to use older drivers.
