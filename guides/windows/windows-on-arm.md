# Windows on ARM



## Overview

We are now seeing Windows computers running on ARM processors. This holds gives us the possibility for cooler running, high-performance machines with great battery life.

Unfortunately, As of 2024/06/18 no drawing tablets work when used with Windows on ARM processors. I had been hoping that tablet manufacturers would have already updated their drivers in preparing for the widespread avialability PCs in June of 2024. However that did not happen. Existing drivers do not work correctly.

I do expect this situation will be addressed quickly with driver updates. And I will update this page as the situation evolves.
