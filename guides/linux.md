# Linux

I don't have any experience with drawing tablets and Linux. However, here are some resources I found that you may find useful.

## Drivers

**WACOM**

Many distros come with Wacom drivers pre-installed. More details here: [https://support.wacom.com/hc/en-us/articles/1500006331202-Does-Wacom-have-a-Tablet-Driver-that-will-support-Linux](https://support.wacom.com/hc/en-us/articles/1500006331202-Does-Wacom-have-a-Tablet-Driver-that-will-support-Linux)&#x20;

**NON-WACOM**

Some tablet manufacters ship their own linux drivers.

**OpenTabletDriver**

Often, people prefer to use OpenTabletDriver for tablets on linux. This is especially popular in the osu community.
