# Installing multiple tablet drivers on the same computer

## Overview

There are two different cases to consider

* Drivers from different brands (for example: one driver from Wacom and one from Huion)
* Drivers from the same brand ( for example: two different versions of the Wacom driver)

And also whether this works  depends on the operating system

### For MacOS

* Tablet drivers from different brands seem to peacefully coexist on MacOS. In MY EXPERIENCE you can install them and they will not interfere with each other.
* Tablet drivers from the same brand - usually you can only have one version installed at one time.

### For Windows

* Tablet drivers from different brands seem to conflict with each other. I recommend installing only a single tablet driver at one time.
* Tablet drivers from the same brand - usually you can only have one version installed at one time.
