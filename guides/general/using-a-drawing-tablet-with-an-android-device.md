# Using a drawing tablet with an Android device

## Overview

Depending on the android device you have and the specific tablet you may be able to use your android device with your drawing tablet.

Do not assume a tablet works with an android device. Check with a manufacturer before trying this. Also be clear on how the tablet will connect to the android device. And for pen displays you need to account for how the tablet will get power.

## General considerations

* You may not be able to use the full active area of your tablet.
* There are no manufacturer drivers to install, so you have to rely on the built in support on the android device.
* If your tablet has buttons, dials, etc. As far as I know there is no way to configure what those buttons do with an android device.
* The built-in support for tablets does not include any way to control the pressure curve of the pen. So, you'll have to resort to controlling pressure curves in the applications you use on your android device.
* For a list of applications that work on Android go here: [**Applications**](../../applications/).

## Considerations for a pen tablet

* Bluetooth. I don't know if this will work. I haven't ever tried.

## Considerations for a pen display

* Your android device must have a USB-C port that supports DP alt mode. Not all Android device support have such USB-C ports.
* The USB-C cable you use to connect the tablet to the android device must be capable of transmitting a display signal.
* Your phone is unlikely to provide enough power for the display panel of the pen display, so you'll need to supply more power to the tablet through some other port on the tablet.

## Android setups I have tried

**Setup 1: Huion Kamvas 13 + Samsung Galaxy Tab S8 Ultra + Microsoft Surface Thunderbolt 4 Dock**&#x20;

* S8 Ultra connected to the dock
* Kamvas top USB-C port connected to Huion 3-in-1 cable&#x20;
* 3-in-1 cable red USB-A end (for power) connected to dock.
* 3-in-1 cable black USB-A end (for data ) connected to dock.
* 3-in-1 cable HDMI end not connected
* Thunderbolt 3 cable connect to lower USB-C port on Kamvas
* Result:
  * I was able to paint with pressure using the Infinite Painter app on the Kamvas 13 screen.

**Other setup notes**

* Samsung Galaxy S9 FE does not work with an external monitor so I was unable to get it to work a drawing tablet.
