# Model names vs model numbers

## Overview

When purchasing or discussing drawing tablets you should <mark style="color:red;">**never rely on the name alone**</mark>. You should always make sure which **model numbe**r you're talking about.

* The naming of drawing tablets is simply too confusing.
* The names can be confusingly similar.
* The same name might be used for different versions in different years
* The names meaning might have changed over the years.

All these issues can cause people to purchase the wrong tablet or purchase the wrong accessories for the tablet.

## The name name used for multiple tablets

### **Example: Wacom One**&#x20;

Currently this describes **5 different tablets** of different kinds and manufacturer in different years and of different levels of quality.

* **Wacom One GEN1 (DTC-133)** - a pen display released in 2019
* **Wacom One 12 GEN2 (DTC-121)** - a pen display released in 2023 (I don't recommend this tablet)
* **Wacom One 13 touch GEN2 (DTH-134)** - a pen display released in 2023 (I don't recommend this tablet)
* **Wacom One S GEN2 (CTC-4110WL)** - a pen tablet released in 2023 (I HIGHLY don't recommend this tablet)
* **Wacom One M GEN2 (CTC-6110WL)** - a pen tablet released in 2023 (I HIGHLY don't recommend this tablet)

## Names that are too similar

### Example: Wacom One and One by Wacom

* **Wacom One** - any one of 5 higher-end consumer tablets (3 pen displays and 2 pen tablets)
* **One by Wacom** - two low-end consumer tablets. Don't let "low-end" fool you. These are excellent tablets.

### **Example: XP-Pen Artist 16 Pro and XP-Pen Artist Pro 16**

These tablets names differ by where the word "Pro" is in their name. One has it in the middle and one has it a the end.

* Artist Pro 16 (ID160F-E) ([product page](https://www.xp-pen.com/product/artist-pro-16.html))
* Artist 16 Pro (doesn't have a model number) ([product page](https://www.xp-pen.com/product/artist-16-pro.html))

## Names reused for different releases

### Example: Wacom Intuos Pro

<table><thead><tr><th>Model ID</th><th width="120">Year</th><th>Name</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>PTH-860</td><td>2017</td><td>Intuos Pro Large (2017)</td></tr><tr><td>PTH-851</td><td>2013</td><td>Intuos Pro Large (2013)</td></tr><tr><td>PTH-660</td><td>2017</td><td>Intuos Pro Medium (2017)</td></tr><tr><td>PTH-651</td><td>2013</td><td>Intuos Pro Medium (2013)</td></tr><tr><td>PTH-460</td><td>2019</td><td>Intuos Pro Small (2019)</td></tr><tr><td>PTH-451</td><td>2013</td><td>Intuos Pro Small (2013)</td></tr></tbody></table>

## Meanings of names have changed over the years

### Example: Wacom Intuos

Originally:

* "Intuos" designated Wacom's professional line of pen tablets.&#x20;
* "Baboo" identified their consumer line

But Wacom at some point switched to:

* "Intuos Pro" designated their professional line
* "Intuos" identified their consumer line

## PRO does not mean better

You will occasionally see a products marketed as:

* Foobar tablet
* Foobar tablet PRO

It is tempting to believe that the PRO version must be better.

This is sometimes NOT the case.

Sometimes PRO versions were released some years before the non-PRO versions and the technology of the non-PRO versions has surpassed that of the PRO models.
