# Using a drawing tablet with an iPad or iPhone

## Overview

With the popularity of iPads and iPhones, it's natural that people ask if they can use a drawing table with their Apple Device.

The summary is:

* You can use a pen tablet (screenless tablet) with an iPad or iPhone only under very specific conditions (specific tablets, and specific apps).
* There is currently no way to use a pen display (screen tablet) with an iPad or iPhone.



## Pen tablets&#x20;

In some **very specific cases** it is possible to use a pen tablet (a screenless tablet) with an iOS device.

**Applications** - currently the only app that I know of that supports using a pen tablet on an iOS device is IbisPaint. The Ibis Paint app on iPad ([https://ibispaint.com/](https://ibispaint.com/)) supports several specific pen tablets (Huion and XP-Pen) when they are connected via Bluetooth.&#x20;

**Connectivity requirements** - At least with IbisPaint, the only a wireless Bluetooth connection with the  tablet is supported. Using a USB-C cable does not work. This automatically excludes any tablets that do not support wireless.

It is possible in some limited cases.

The only app I know of that supports it is Ibis Paint. I can confirm I made it work with

**Wacom** specifically calls out that their Intuos models do not work with iPhones or iPads in this document: [Wacom - Does the Wacom Intuos pen tablet work with an iPhone or iPad?](https://support.wacom.com/hc/en-us/articles/1500006331582-Does-the-Wacom-Intuos-pen-tablet-work-with-an-iPhone-or-iPad-)

## Pen displays

Currently I don't know of any way to use a pen display with an iPad.

For example, if you connect a Wacom Cintiq Pro 22 to an M4 iPad here is what happens:

* The iPad will treat the pen display just like a normal monitor
* Using the pen on the pen display does nothing
* Even though this pen display supports touch, if you put your fingers on it nothing happens.
