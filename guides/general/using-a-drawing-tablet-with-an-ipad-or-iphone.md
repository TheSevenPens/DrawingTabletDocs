# Using a drawing tablet with an iPad or iPhone

## Overview

With the popularity of iPads and iPhones, it's natural that people ask if they can use a drawing table with their Apple Device.

The summary is:

* You can use a pen tablet (screenless tablet) with an iPad or iPhone only under very specific conditions - with specific apps and specific tablets.
* There is currently no way to use a pen display (screen tablet) with an iPad or iPhone.

## Pen tablets > HiPaint

HiPaint supports connecting a drawing tablet to an iOS device

* ONLY via Bluetooth. Wired connection is NOT supported.
* It is unclear which tablets are supported or not supported. I tested it with a Huion Inspiroy Frego M (L610)

There are instructions in the HiPaint user manual explaining how to connect to a tablet.

## Wacom

**Wacom** specifically calls out that their Intuos models do not work with iPhones or iPads in this document: [Wacom - Does the Wacom Intuos pen tablet work with an iPhone or iPad?](https://support.wacom.com/hc/en-us/articles/1500006331582-Does-the-Wacom-Intuos-pen-tablet-work-with-an-iPhone-or-iPad-)

## Pen displays

Currently I don't know of any way to use a pen display with an iPad.

For example, if you connect a Wacom Cintiq Pro 22 to an M4 iPad here is what happens:

* The iPad will treat the pen display just like a normal monitor
* Using the pen on the pen display does nothing
* Even though this pen display supports touch, if you put your fingers on it nothing happens.
