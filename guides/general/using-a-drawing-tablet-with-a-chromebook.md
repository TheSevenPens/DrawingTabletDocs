# Using a drawing tablet with a Chromebook



## Overview

Pen tablets and pen displays can be used with Chromebooks. But be aware of the limitations.&#x20;

## Compatibility

**\You MUST verify compatibility** with your tablet manufacturer. Not all tablets work with Chromebooks. Only some do. I suggest you also seek out the opinion of other users of your tablet model and see what their experience has been with Chromebooks.

## Drivers

Tablets work with the built-in drivers in the Chromebooks not the manufacturer drivers. This means that **some features of your tablet and pen may not work with a Chromebook**.

## Pen tablets & mismatched aspect ratios

With pen tablets you will not be force the active area to match the display of the Chromebook. This means there will be a distortion to your drawing. More here: [**Matching aspect ratios**](../customizing-your-experience/matching-aspect-ratios.md).
