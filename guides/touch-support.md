# Touch support

**Availability of touch support**

Only a very small number of drawing tablets are touch sensitive.&#x20;

The tablets I know that support touch:

* SOME of the Wacom Cintiq Pro line
* SOME of the Wacom Intuos Pro line
* Wacom One 13 touch GEN2 (DTH-134)

**Quality of touch support**

In my opinion, no drawing tablet offers a great touch experience. Some are truly terrible. Even the ones with the best touch support are NOT comparable to a laptop trackpad or an iPad which are much better.&#x20;

**Operating system support**

If you do have a tablet that supports touch, it will work MUCH better on Windows. Windows has had deep touch support for a very long time.

MacOS does not have as good support for touch.

**Compared to the iPad**

Again, in neither case does touch come close to what you would experience with an iPad. One area where the iPad is clearly better is palm rejection.

**My own use of touch**

The very first thing I do with my tablets that support touch is disable the touch feature.

**Notes on Wacom Cintiq Pro models**

The recent Cintiq Pro 16 and 27 models from Wacom introduced in 2021 and 2022 have much better touch than older Wacom models, but it is not as good as what you would get from an iPad.
