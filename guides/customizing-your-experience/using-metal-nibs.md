# Using metal nibs

## Introduction

If you are wearing out your plastic pen nibs too quickly, you might be considering a metal nib. Metal nibs in theory never wear out.&#x20;

## Metal nibs can damage pens

<mark style="color:red;">**I DO NOT recommend using a metal nib**</mark>

* **ferrite core damage** - Some people report that the metal nibs can cause the pen's ferrite core to easily break. When the ferrite core breaks it cannot be replaced. You have to buy a new pen. I did not experience damage to the ferrite core even after I dropped my KP-504E pen repeatedly with the metal nib hitting the floor directly. However, I don't doubt that others have experienced real damage.
* **pressure sensor damage** - I personally experienced that a metal nib cause a permanent increase in the initial activation force of my Wacom Pro Pen 2. This means the pen become less sensitive and going back plastic nib does not restore a low initial activation force. See this video for more details ([https://youtu.be/WvmMHzZoclg](https://youtu.be/WvmMHzZoclg\))).

## Metal nibs and pen displays

<mark style="color:red;">**I DO NOT recommend using a metal nib directly against the glass of a pen display**</mark>

I haven't tried it with a pen display and I right now would not recommend someone doing doing that. I do believe there's a chance it can damage the screen. I've even seen people with plastic nibs damage the screen of their pen display.&#x20;

If someone is going to do use a metal nib with a pen display, I would recommend using a protective sheet. See this doc [protective sheets](../../accessories/protective-sheets/).
