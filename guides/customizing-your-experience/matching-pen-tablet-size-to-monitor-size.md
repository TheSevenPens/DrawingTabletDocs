# Matching pen tablet size to monitor size

## Overview

There is a relationship between the size of a pen tablet and the size of your monitor that you should pay attention to. They both have different sizes and certain combinations may work better than others.

My general guidance works out like this:

| Pen tablet Size Catgogory | Monitor Size |
| ------------------------- | ------------ |
| Extra Large (23")         | 40" - 50"    |
| Large (15")               | 30" - 40"    |
| Medium (11")              | 20" - 30"    |
| Small (7")                | 20" - 25"    |

This table is based on my preferences - you might find you find that difference combinations work better.
