# Matching pen tablet size to monitor size

## Overview

There is a relationship between the size of a pen tablet and the size of your monitor that you should pay attention to. They both have different sizes and certain combinations may work better than others.

For more general information about choosing the right size, go here: [**Choosing the right tablet size**](choosing-the-right-tablet-size.md).&#x20;

## General guidance

This table is based on my preferences - you might find you find that difference combinations work better.

<table><thead><tr><th width="225">Pen tablet size </th><th width="191">Example dimensions</th><th>Monitor Size</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Extra Large (23")</td><td>19" x 12"</td><td>40" - 50"</td></tr><tr><td>Large (15")<br></td><td>12" x 8.5"</td><td>30" - 40"</td></tr><tr><td>Medium (11")<br></td><td>8.5" x 6"<br>10" x 6"</td><td>20" - 30"</td></tr><tr><td>Small (7")</td><td>â€Ž6" x 4"</td><td>20" - 25"</td></tr></tbody></table>
