# Mirroring or extending your desktop to a pen display

## Overview

In terms of what you see on it, your pen display is just another monitor/display to your computer. So, you can control how the computer shows its desktop to the pen display.

You have two options:

* **Extend the desktop** - this means you can see different things on the pen display from your monitor. This is what I recommend you use.
* **Duplicate the desktop (aka "Mirror ther desktop")** - This means your pen display and monitor will try to show the same exact thing. Sometimes this is very useful but generally I think Extend is better choice for most people and situations.&#x20;

## Steps to control extend vs duplicate

The steps depend on which operating system you are using.

### Windows (11)

* Open **Display Settings**
* Select the display of your tablet
* Then select **Duplicate to mirror**

### Mac OS (Monterey)

* Go to **Displays > Display Settings**
* Select your monitor, then set **Use As** to **Primary Display**
* Then select your drawing tablet's display and set **Use As** to **Mirror**.
