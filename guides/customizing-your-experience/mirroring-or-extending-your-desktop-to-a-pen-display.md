# Mirroring or extending your desktop to a pen display

## Overview

In terms of what you see on it, your pen display is just another monitor/display to your computer. So, you can control how the computer shows its desktop to the pen display.

You have two options:

* **Extend the desktop** - this means you can see different things on the pen display from your monitor. This is what I recommend you use.
* **Duplicate the desktop (aka "Mirror ther desktop")** - This means your pen display and monitor will try to show the same exact thing. Sometimes this is very useful but generally I think Extend is better choice for most people and situations.&#x20;

## Steps to control extend vs duplicate

The steps depend on which operating system you are using.

### Windows 11

* Open **Display Settings**
* The displays your computer is connected to will be shown and each one is numbered. The one in blue is the display currently selected.
  * If a display has two numbers, that means the desktop is being duplicated across those displays
* NOTE: If you only see one display then the these settings do not apply.&#x20;
* Select the display that corresponds to your tablet
* Towards the button right (to the right of the **Identify** button) you will see a dropdown setting that controls how the desktop is being applied to this display. Depending on how the display is already configured, the dropdown will say either
  * **Extend desktop to this display**
  * **Duplicate desktop on X and Y**
    * X and Y will be the numbers referring to the displays
* Switch the dropdown between the **Extend** or **Duplicate** option as needed. &#x20;

### Mac OS (Monterey)

* Go to **Displays > Display Settings**
* Select your monitor, then set **Use As** to **Primary Display**
* Then select your drawing tablet's display and set **Use As** to **Mirror**.
