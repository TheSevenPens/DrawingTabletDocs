# Taking notes with drawing tablets

## Overview

If you need to take notes and especially if you need to be mobile, then in my opinion pen tablets and pen displays aren't great at this task. I don't recommend pen computers either - because they are expensive not responsive enough (too much cursor lag).&#x20;

**What I think works better for people**: standalone devices optimized for a great pen experience for non-drawing scenarios or specifically for note taking such as an Apple iPad.

## Key negatives of using drawing tablets for taking notes

### Negatives of pen tablets&#x20;

* small pen tablets don't offer much space for writing and it can feel cramped. A medium pen tablet is better, but then it takes up much more space.
* pen tablets - because they have no screen - can be awkward to take notes on as you cannot directly see what you are writing.

### Negatives of using pen displays&#x20;

* Pen displays need to be connected to a computer. Although many pen tablets can work wirelessly.
* Pen displays need to be connected to a significant source of power. Even if the tablet can get power from a computer, a laptop may not supply enough power (even if the laptop is plugged into power) or the power requirement may drain the laptop battery quickly.
* Ideally you would use a single cable to connect a pen display to a computer. But for various reasons this is not always possible. As an alternative you may be required to have a more complex cabling arrangement - often using a 3-in-1 cable. More here about [**using one USB-C cable with a pen display**](../pen-displays/connecting-a-pen-display-with-one-usb-c-cable.md).&#x20;
* Pen displays have a lot of cursor lag - this can be very difficult to deal with when taking notes - especially if you write fast. More here: [**lag**](../core-features/lag.md) &#x20;
* If you are note taking in a location where you might drop your pen display, in many cases you will either experience a cracked screen or simply break the tablet entirely. &#x20;

## Alternatives to using drawing tablets for note taking
