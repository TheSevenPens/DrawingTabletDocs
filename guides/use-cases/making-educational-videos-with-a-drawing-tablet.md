# Making educational videos with a drawing tablet

Drawing tablets are heavily used for creating educational content. For example you've probably seen the Khan Academy videos and those are created with a drawing tablet.

## Easy tablet choices

For this you want high reliability and durability and you DO NOT need to spend a lot of money buying a fancy tablet. And for those reasons I'll keep the recommendations short:

**Pen tablets (no screen)**

* One by Wacom Medium (CTL-672)
* Wacom Intuos Medium (CTL-4100) - the only real advantage of this tablet is that it has buttons on the tablet that you can assign shortcut keys for.

**Pen displays (have a screen)**

* XP-Pen Artist 12 GEN2 (CD120FH)
* XP-Pen Artist 13 GEN2 (CD130FH)
* Wacom One GEN1 (DTC-133)

## Which tablet does Sal Khan use?

Sal Khan uses a Wacom Intuos Pro Medium for his videos. That is an AMAZING tablet, but honestly overkill. You can get by with a much less expensive tablet.

**Which specific model of Intuos Pro he is using?**

It does NOT look to be the latest model of Intuos Pro Medium (PTH-660). You can tell this because in one of his videos he shows the tablet and I can see some things that clearly mark it as an older tablet.

* The pen does not look like the Wacom Pro Pen 2 that comes with the PTH-660
* The USB-cable connects with a thicker end and is not the L-shaped connector that comes PTH-660&#x20;
* The back of the tablet has the older Wacom branding.&#x20;
