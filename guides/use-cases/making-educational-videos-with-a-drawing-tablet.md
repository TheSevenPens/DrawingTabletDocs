# Making educational videos with a drawing tablet

Drawing tablets are heavily used for creating educational content. For example you've probably seen the Khan Academy videos and those are created with a drawing tablet.

## Easy tablet choices

For this you want high reliability and durability. And for that reason I'll keep the recommendations simple:

* One by Wacom Medium (CTL-672)
* Wacom Intuos Medium (CTL-4100) - the only real advanage of this tablet is that it has buttons on the tablet that you can assign shortcut keys for.

## Which tablet does Sal Khan use?

Sal Khan uses a Wacom Intuos Pro Medium (It looks like a earlier version and not the latest PTH-660) for his videos. That is an AMAZING tablet, but honestly overkill. You can get by with a much less expensive tablet.&#x20;
