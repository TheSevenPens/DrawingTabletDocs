# Using a drawing tablet as a mouse replacement

If your are a creative, then it's pretty obvious why there's a benefit to using a drawing tablet instead of a mouse when you are drawing.

Some people simply want to use the drawing tablet as a mouse replacement. They can definitely serve this purpose. &#x20;

## **My personal experience**

I did this for about 10 years. Although I always had a mouse connected, 99.9% of the time I used a drawing tablet.

## **Size**

I used a MEDIUM sized tablet - something the size of a Wacom Intuos Pro Medium. &#x20;

For a few years I a SMALL sized tablet - something the size of a Wacom Intuos Pro small. When I was using the small tablet, I was in a non-artistic phase so I was not drawing with it much.

I generally recommend MEDIUM sized tablets as a mouse replacement, but SMALL can work also.

## **Wrist pain**

One of the reasons I avoided using the mouse was that it was causing wrist pain. The pen was helpful in **reducing** the pain. However, if I do draw a lot over a month or so, I can develop **wrist pain**. So a drawing tablet might help, but it will not eliminate these kinds of problems.

## **Holding the pen while typing**

To make it easier to switch between typing and using the pen I ALWAYS held the pen in my hand even when typing.

When drawing I held it like you would normally hold a pen, but when I switched to typing, as I extended out my fingers the pen I would rotate the pen so the tip is pointing up and to the side.&#x20;

## Pen pressure

The vast majority of drawing tablets support pressure sensitivity. For a mouse replacement, tilt is not important.

## Pen tilt

The vast majority of drawing tablets support tilt. This is useful for art. Even then not all artists use the tilt feature. For a mouse replacement, tilt is not relevant.

## Sturdiness

Modern mice are incredibly sturdy devices. They don't even have moving parts except for the buttons. You could drop them from your desk and they will still work.

Drawing tablet pens are much more sensitive. They have more delicate and sensitive parts. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND that you DO NOT DROP THEM. Sometimes they work perfectly after that. But they can malfunction in all sorts of ways after a drop. And keep in mind that the pens are not cheap.  If you need to buy a replacement it will be anywhere from $35 USD to $90 USD.&#x20;

## Pointer positioning

Mice move the pointer through relative positioning while drawing tablets use absolute positioining: [**Absolute versus relative positioning**](../../core-features/absolute-versus-relative-positioning.md).

However, you can configure the tablet driver to use mouse mode to provide relative positioning which will make it feel more like a mouse. more here: [**mouse mode**](../../core-features/mouse-mode.md). &#x20;

## Aspect ratios

If you are using a pen tablet (a tablet without a screen) you ABSOLUTELY SHOULD also configure the tablet to match its active area to that of your monitor. More here: [**Matching aspect ratios**](../customizing-your-experience/matching-aspect-ratios.md)&#x20;

## Moving the pointer vs clicking

In a a mouse, you can independently move and click. This means you can move the pointer without accidentally clicking.

The same thing works with drawing tablet pen. But you should realize how it works.

* To move without clicking - you have to hold the pen above the tablet (within a range of about 10mm). This is called hover. more here: [**Pen hover**](../../core-features/pen-hover.md).&#x20;
* To click - you tap down on the tablet with the pen
* To move AND click at the same time - you press down on the tablet and move the pen. The click lasts as long as you are touching the tablet.

## Holding pointer position completely still

With a mouse this is SUPER EASY you can jsut not move the mouse. And it is EASY to keep a mouse still. You can even let go of the mouse from your hand the pointer won't move.

With a drawing tablet, this is actually very hard. Because you have to HOVER the pen at the exact same spot above the tablet. That is very hard to do, because any motion of your hand will often move the pointer.&#x20;

## Not clicking

It's easy to avoid accidental clicks with a mouse.&#x20;

With a pen you have to HOVER. And if you accidentally touch the surface it will count as a click.

## Drivers

For the vast majority of mice, you can just plug them into a computer and they will "just work". This is because the computer has drivers for mice already installed.

That isn't quite the case for drawing tablets. You will need to install the tablet driver.

## Wired vs Wireless

Mice can be:

* Wired only
* Wireless only
* Wired + Wireless

Drawing tablets can be

* Wired only
* Wired + Wireless

There are no drawing tablets that are wireless only.

## Tablets that would work well as a mouse replacement

Lots of them would work. The easy choices are:

* One for Wacom Small CTL-472
* One for Wacom Medium CTL-672&#x20;
* Wacom Intuos Small CTL-4100
* Wacom Intuos Medium CTL-6100

Generally, I would suggest a medium size, though small can work also.
