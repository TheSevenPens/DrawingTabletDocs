# Using a drawing tablet instead of a mouse

If your are a creative, then it's pretty obvious why there's a benefit to using a drawing tablet instead of a mouse when you are drawing.

But some people, simply want to use the drawing tablet as a mouse replacement in general.&#x20;

## **My personal experience**

I did this for about 10 years. Although I always had a mouse connected, 99.9% of the time I used a drawing tablet.

**Size**

I used a MEDIUM sized tablet - something the size of a Wacom Intuos Pro Medium. &#x20;

For a few years I a SMALL sized tablet - something the size of a Wacom Intuos Pro small. When I was using the small tablet, I was in a non-artistic phase so I was not drawing with it much.

**Ergonomics**

One of the reasons I avoided using the mouse was that it was causing wrist pain.

The pen was helpful in **reducing** the pain. However, if I do draw a lot over a month or so, I can develop **wrist pain**.

**Holding the pen while typing**

To make it easier to switch between typing and using the pen I ALWAYS held the pen in my hand even when typing.

When drawing I held it like you would normally hold a pen, but when I switched to typing, as I extended out my fingers the pen I would rotate the pen so the tip is pointing up and to the side.&#x20;

**Other experiences**

Here's a detailed write up of someone's experience: ([https://www.reddit.com/r/wacom/comments/136u00y/replacing\_your\_mouse\_with\_a\_drawing\_tabletpen/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wacom/comments/136u00y/replacing\_your\_mouse\_with\_a\_drawing\_tabletpen/))

## Tablets that would work well as a mouse replacement

Lots of them would work. The easy choices are:

* One for Wacom Small CTL-472
* One for Wacom Medium CTL-672
* Wacom Intuos Small CTL-4100
* Wacom Intuos Medium CTL-6100

Generally, I would suggest a medium size, though small can work also.
