# Pen compatibility with drawing tablets

## Overview

<mark style="color:red;">**Drawing tablets tablets are very specific about which pens they work with. Never buy a pen without verifying compatibility first. The best way to confirm compatibility is to contact support.**</mark>

## **Key points**

* Usually a drawing tablet is only compatible with the exact pen model it came with
* A pen from Manufacturer A will most likely not work with Tablet from manufacturer B.
* A pen from Manufacturer A may not work with all tablets made by manufacturer A
* Using the same technology such as "EMR" does not mean two pens are interchangeable.
* Apple Pencils are only compatible with Apple iPads.
* Wacom has so many tablets and and pens that compatibility can get confusing. More here: [**Wacom pen compatibility**](../../product-info/wacom/wacom-pen-compatibility.md).

If you need to replace a pen, find out the model number that is compatible with your tablet. Then order that exact model. If you don't know the model you need, contact support for your drawing tablet.

## What causes pen incompatibility?

### Tech differences

* Different pens use different resonant frequencies for their EMR signal. So pens that don't use the same frequency as the tablets expect will not be compatible
* Different pens use different techniques for transmitting some kinds of information back to the tablet, and these techniques have to also be supported by the tablet to work.&#x20;
* This is sometimes why you can for example try using brand X pen with brand UY tablet, and the tablet might be able to sense the position of the pen, but not the button presses, or pressure.&#x20;

### Non-tech causes

**Driver selectively excludes pens** - I know of at least one case with Wacom where the pen and tablet would actually work but the Wacom driver prevents it. The way around this is to use [**opentabletdriver** ](../drivers/opentabletdriver/)which does not have that restriction.&#x20;
