## Increasing pen weight

The vast majority of EMR pens are not designed to have their weight altered.

The only exception to this is the Wacom Pro Pen 3 which can be easily unscrewed and a custom metal rod from Wacom can be inserted to add weight to the pen. &#x20;

If you do want to add weight to the pen, consider adding tape. Many osu! players add raquetball tape aorund their pens for a bettwe grip. Maybe that would add enough weight for your needs.
