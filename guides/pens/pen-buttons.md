# Pen buttons

## Number of buttons

* The vast majority of drawing tablet pens have two buttons.&#x20;
* Though some consumer Wacom models have only a single button.&#x20;
* A few pens have three buttons - for example a Wacom Pro Pen 3

## Default two buttons configuration&#x20;

These are the default settings for Wacom pens with two buttons.

* **lower button** (the one closer to the nib) set to perform a **mouse right-click**
* **upper button** (the one further away from the nib) set to perform a **mouse left double-click**

## Other configurations for pen buttons

&#x20;Other things people configure their buttons to do:

* a **CTRL-Z keypress** to perform UNDO
* **SPACE** key - in many apps, SPACE + dragging pen will pan the drawing canvas
* **CTRL+SPACE** - in many apps, this will zoom into and out of the canvas (Krita, Photoshop, Illustrator)&#x20;
