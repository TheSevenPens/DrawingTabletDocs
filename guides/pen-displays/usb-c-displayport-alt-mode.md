# USB-C DisplayPort alt mode

### Overview

If you wish to transmit a display signal from you computer to your pen display via USB-C then the ports and cables need to support DP alt mode.

Support for DP alt mode is something you must verify. Multiple techniques are possible.

## Verifying if your USB-C port or cable supports DP alt mode

### Option 1: DisplayPort alt mode symbol

There is a special DisplayPort symbol that specifically indicates the cable or port supports DP alt mode. Unfortunately many cables that DO support DP alt mode, do not have this logo.

### Option 2: Thunderbolt symbol

If you see a Thunderbolt symbol on your USB-C port or USB-C cable, then the port or cable supports DP-alt mode.

Here is an example of two USB-C ports with the Thhunderbolt symbol

Unfortunately, many USB-C thunderbolt ports and cables simply do not have the thunderbolt logo on them.&#x20;

### Option 3: Unlabeled ports and cables

At this point you have several strategies:

* Read the documentation. Look for for the words "Thunderbolt" of "DP alt mode". Sometimes the documentation will say something more ambiguous like "supports display".
* Contact product support from your manufacturer. Just ask them!
* Reach out to an online community and ask if anyone has been able to use that port in their tablet to receive a display signal.&#x20;

## Things go keep in mind

* You have to verify DP support for the USB-C port AND the USB-C cable. Just having one support DP alt mode is not enough.
