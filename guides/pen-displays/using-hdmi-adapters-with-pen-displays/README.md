# Using HDMI adapters with pen displays

## Before you begin

You may want to familiarize yourself with this doc before you continue if you are not experienced connection options: [**Connecting a pen display to a computer**](../../connections-and-cabling/connecting-a-pen-display.md)

## Overview

Sometimes the tablet needs to be connected to your computer through HDMI. This means that there's a cable coming from your tablet that has a ‚Äúmale‚Äù HDMI plug. And of course you then need a ‚Äúfemale‚Äù HDMI receptacle.

‚ÄúPlug‚Äù and ‚Äúreceptable‚Äù are the official terms, by the way üòä

However it is possible you can use another port.

## Order of preference of ports for adapters&#x20;

Not all ports are equally good for connecting to HDMI. Some you should try first because they will give you a better experience.

If you don't have an HDMI port you should try alternative ports in the order below.&#x20;

* DisplayPort
* USB-C (remember not all USB-C ports support sending a display signal).
* DVI
* VGA

## General flakiness

Generally these adapters "just work". But sometimes there are odd quirks on some computers and they just don't work or not work correctly.
