# USB-C to HDMI adapters

Not all USB-C ports carry a display signal. You need one that can. Read more here: [**USB-C DisplayPort alt mode**](../usb-c-displayport-alt-mode.md)

**Quality**. There is no loss in quality using this kind of adapter.

**What I use**

I've had good luck with the "Amazon Basics Premium Aluminum USB-C to HDMI Cable Adapter (Thunderbolt 3 Compatible) 4K@60Hz, 6-Foot, Black". Note that is an entire cable, not just an adapter. link: [https://www.amazon.com/dp/B083KV1BR3](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B083KV1BR3)&#x20;

This comes in different lengths (6ft and 3ft) and different refresh rates (60Hz and 30Hz). Make sure you buy one long enough for your needs and get the 60Hz version.
