# DVI to HDMI adapters

## Overview

DVI is a bit of an older display protocol type. There are DVI-to-HDMI adapters on the market but I don't  have a direct experience in using them.

If your computer has a DVI port:

* You need to know the "shape" of the DVI port (see below)
* And get a male DVI to female HDMI adapter that matches that port type

## Example

Here's an example of such an adapter.
