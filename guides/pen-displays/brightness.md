# Brightness

## Overview

Drawing tablets that have an embedded display also have maximum typical brightness for that display.&#x20;

You You have been exposed to many Displays in televisions in phones and watches. Here I'd like to set your expectations about what you're going to experience in terms of brightness. for drawing tablets.f you are buying a tablet, you should be aware of the brightness and how it fits into your workflow. For example:

* Do you work indoors vs outdoors
* If indoors, are there lots of lights around or do you work in a dark area
* If outdoors, are you working in a covered area or in direct sunlight&#x20;

## Measurement

Brightness is measured in cd/m2 ([Candela per square meter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Candela\_per\_square\_metre)) but that is hard to type so man people use the equivalent unit of **nit**.

## Range of brightness values

Overall pen display are between 220 to 250 nits.

A few very bright pen displays have a brightness >= 300 nits.&#x20;

## Guidance

This is based on MY experience

* If working indoors in a darker room: 200 to 250 nits is enough.&#x20;
* If working indoors in a brighter room (many lights or windows): 250 to 240 is enough
* If working outdoors then you should have at least 500 nits.

Of course, what will work for you depends on your personal preferences. &#x20;
