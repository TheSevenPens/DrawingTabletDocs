# Brightness

## Overview

Drawing tablets that have an embedded display panel and those display panels have maximum typical brightness. You have been exposed to many display panels in televisions in phones and watches. Here I'd like to set your expectations about what you're going to experience in terms of brightness for drawing tablets.

## Measurement

Brightness is measured in cd/m2 ([Candela per square meter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Candela\_per\_square\_metre)) but that is hard to type so man people use the equivalent unit of **nit**.

## Guidance

This is based on MY experience

* If working indoors in a darker room: 200 to 250 nits is enough.&#x20;
* If working indoors in a brighter room (many lights or windows): 250 to 240 is enough
* If working outdoors then you should have at least 500 nits.

Of course, what will work for you depends on your personal preferences. &#x20;

## Environment

You are buying a tablet, be aware of the environment you are using the tablet in. This greatly affects the brightness you need.

Typical environments

* **indoors + dark** - low amounts of ambient light. Light conditions are not changing.
  * 200 nits to 250 nits is enough
* **indoors + bright** - lots of ambient light. Maybe be to bright indoor lights. Maybe due to windows. If window, then brightness may change dramatically because of cloud cover.
  * 250 nits to 350 nits is enough
* **outdoors + under shade** - overall bright environment with lots of ambient light. No direct sunlight hitting your tablet.
  * at least 500 inits is needed
* **outdoors + no shade** - very fright. Sunlight hitting your tablet.
  * at least 1000 nits is needed

## What you can expect from drawing tablets

Overall, display panels for drawing tablets fall in the range of 200 to 400 nits.

* Many are within the range 220 to 250 nits.
* Only a few are >= 300 nits.

## Fan noise

A few tablets (only Wacom as far as I know) have fans. And these fans help to keep their  brighter displays cool. The fan noise can be disturbing for some people. For others it doesn't matter.&#x20;
