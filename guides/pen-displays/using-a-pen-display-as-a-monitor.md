# Using a pen display as a monitor

## Overview

You can use a pen display like a regular monitor. However, there are a few things you should be aware of.

## Is it safe?

It's completely safe.&#x20;

I use my Kamvas 22 Plus as a second display and leave it on 24/7 and my computer is set to never sleep so it is always showing something. I've done this with other pen displays also.

## Refresh Rate

Pen displays rarely have high refresh rates. Typically they will be 60Hz. Higher refresh rates are rare. As of January 2022, only a single pen display (Wacom Cintiq pro 27 DTH271) supports up to 120Hz.

## Display inputs and cabling

A monitor often has a variety of inputs. For example, most of the monitors I have support these display inputs:

* HDMI 2.0
* Display Port
* USB-C

Some pen displays have a variety of inputs. The Wacom Cintiq pro 27 DTH271 is a great example of one. It supports all of the inputs mentioned above.

But many pen displays are going the route of only supporting USB-C for input of a display signal.

Often you will see that a pen display  that has only a single USB-C port to which must be attached a special 3-in-1 cable.

The 3-in-1 cable has a USB-C on one end that splits into 3 outputs on the other end:

* HDMI  - display signal
* USB A - sends pen/tablet data
* USB C - intended for power delivery only

If the USB-C port is used for 3-in-1 display, you should also be aware that the USB-C port may have a proprietary design and may only work with that 3-in-1 cable. Using other cables may even damage the tablet or the computer. So if you want to use your own cable, contact your manufacturer's support team first.

## Aspect ratio

Typically monitors have to aspect ratios: 16:9 and 16:10. And there are variety of widescreen or ultra-widescreen monitors that support many other aspect ratios.

Pen displays have much less diversity of aspect ratios. The vast majority of modern pen displays are exactly 16:9. A very small number are 16:10.

## Display panel technology

Monitors and pen displays use various panel tech such as:

* IPS
* TN
* VA

As of January 2023, while you can find monitors that use OLED, no pen displays support OLED panels.

## VESA-mounting

Most often monitors support VESA mounting so you can attach them to a stand or an arm.

Many pen displays support VESA mounting also. However, the pen displays that are 16" or smaller often do not support VESA mounting. LIkely they do not support VESA mounting because these sizes of pen displays are to thin to do so.

## Power cabling

Monitors tend to have the normal power cables and adapters.

Modern pen displays tend to support getting power via their USB C ports.&#x20;

## Anti-glare sparkle

It varies quite a bit among pen displays, but often they exhibit more Anti-Glare sparkle than monitors. Sometimes it is quite noticable. Some people are very irritated by the visual effect of this anti-glare sparkle.

## Speakers

Many monitors come with built-in speakers. They usually sound terrible, but they can be useful.

As far as I am aware, no pen displays do not have speakers.

## Multiple simultaneous inputs: Picture-by-picture, Picture-in-picture

One of the benefits of supporting multiple display input ports is that it makes it possible to display two or more inputs simultaneously.

Many monitors allow this now and it is very useful for very wide monitors.

This is not something found on pen displays. Or at least it is very rare.

## Heat

It's common question whether pen displays would get to hot if they are continually used. Pen displays don't get any hotter than a normal monitor.&#x20;

## Noise

Monitors are almost always completely silent and don't even have fans.

However, some pen displays - notably some Wacom Cintiq Pro models - have fans are are known for fan noise. If you are sensitive to noise research this first.&#x20;
