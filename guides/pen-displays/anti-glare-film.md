# Anti-glare film

To prevent glasre, some films use an anti-glare film. Sometimes this is just referred to as a "Matte film".

## Removing film

Some tablets support removing the AG film and even sell replacement films.

## What happens in you remove the film?

I did this with a Huion Kamvas 13

**Pros**

* no anti-glare sparkle
* brighter and more vibrant colors

**Cons**

* more risk of scratching glass - though it has not happened yet with my Kamvas 13
* Glare from lights shows up strongly on the glass
