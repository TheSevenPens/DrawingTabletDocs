# Using HDMI adapters with pen displays

## Before you begin

You may want to familiarize yourself with this doc before you continue if you are not experienced connection options: [**Connecting a pen display to a computer**](../connections-and-cabling/connecting-a-pen-display.md)

## Overview

Sometimes the tablet needs to be connected to your computer through HDMI. This means that there's a cable coming from your tablet that has a ‚Äúmale‚Äù HDMI plug. And of course you then need a ‚Äúfemale‚Äù HDMI receptacle.

‚ÄúPlug‚Äù and ‚Äúreceptable‚Äù are the official terms, by the way üòä

However it is possible you can use another port.

## Order of preference of ports for adapters&#x20;

Not all ports are equally good for connecting to HDMI. Some you should try first because they will give you a better experience.

If you don't have an HDMI port you should try alternative ports in the order below.&#x20;

* DisplayPort
* USB-C (remember not all USB-C ports support sending a display signal).
* DVI
* VGA

## DisplayPort to HDMI adapters

These will be MALE DisplayPort to FEMALE HDMI.

**Quality**: There is no loss in quality when using this kind of adapter.

**What I use**

* Display Port - For a 2K display at 60Hz: [https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00K2E4T88/](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00K2E4T88/)&#x20;
* Mini DisplayPort - for 2K display at 60Hz: [https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00K0UDJFI](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00K0UDJFI)

## USB-C to HDMI adapters

Not all USB-C ports carry a display signal. You need one that can. Read more here: [**USB-C DisplayPort alt mode**](usb-c-displayport-alt-mode.md)

**Quality**. There is no loss in quality using this kind of adapter.

**What I use**

I've had good luck with the "Amazon Basics Premium Aluminum USB-C to HDMI Cable Adapter (Thunderbolt 3 Compatible) 4K@60Hz, 6-Foot, Black". Note that is an entire cable, not just an adapter. link: [https://www.amazon.com/dp/B083KV1BR3](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B083KV1BR3)&#x20;

This comes in different lengths (6ft and 3ft) and different refresh rates (60Hz and 30Hz). Make sure you buy one long enough for your needs and get the 60Hz version.

## DVI to HDMI adapters

These will be MALE DVI to FEMALE HDMI.

I don't have any direct experience with DVI to HDMI, but some people seem to have had success.

Note that there are multiple DCI port shapes

## VGA to HDMI adapters

VGA is a very old display technology. You should use it as a last resort.

**Quality:** Because VGA is analog and must be converted to a digital signal for HDMI, it is possible you might see some degradation in quality.  &#x20;

## Check your requirements

You need to make sure your adapter supports the **resolution** and **refresh rate** that you want from you pen display.

## General flakiness

Generally these adapters "just work". But sometimes there are odd quirks on some computers and they just don't work or not work correctly.
