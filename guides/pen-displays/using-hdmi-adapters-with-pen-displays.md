# Using HDMI adapters with pen displays

Sometimes you will run into a situation where your pen display needs an HDMI port, but all you have is some other kind of port.

Depending on the port you can get an adapter that will convert it to HDMI.

## Order of preference of ports to use for using an adapter

It would be best not to use an adapter, but if you have to you should try the other ports in this order.

* DisplayPort
* USB-C (remember not all USB-C ports support sending a display signal)
* DVI
* VGA

## DisplayPort to HDMI adapters

These will be MALE DisplayPort to FEMALE HDMI.

Quality: There is no loss in quality when using this kind of adapter

These are the ones I personally use:

* Display Port - For a 2K display at 60Hz: [https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00K2E4T88/](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00K2E4T88/)&#x20;
* Mini DisplayPort - for 2K display at 60Hz: [https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00K0UDJFI](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00K0UDJFI)

## USB-C to HDMI adapters

I've had good luck with the "Amazon Basics Premium Aluminum USB-C to HDMI Cable Adapter (Thunderbolt 3 Compatible) 4K@60Hz, 6-Foot, Black". Note that is an entire cable, not just an adapter. link: [https://www.amazon.com/dp/B083KV1BR3](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B083KV1BR3)&#x20;

## DVI to HDMI adapters

These will be MALE DVI to FEMALE HDMI.

I don't have any direct experience with DVI to HDMI, but some people seem to have had success.

note that there are multiple DCI port shapes

## VGA to HDMI adapters

VGA is a very old display technology.

You should use it as a last resort.

Quality: Because VGA is analog and must be converted to a digital signal for HDMI, it is possible you might see some degradation in quality.  &#x20;

## Check your requirements

You need to make sure your adapter supports the **resolution** and **refresh rate** that you want from you pen display.

## General flakiness

Generally these adapters "just work". But sometimes there are odd quirks on some computers and they just don't work or not work correctly.
