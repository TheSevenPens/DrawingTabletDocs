# Connecting a pen display with one USB-C cable

## Overview

It is POSSIBLE for SOME pen displays to be powered by a single USB-C cable.

## Key points

**Scenario support:** The manufacturer must say this this is possible. Just because their tablet has a USB-C port is not enough.

**Power:** Pen displays require a lot of power for the display. So typically this works when you are using a tablet that is 16" or smaller.

**USB-C Port on the computer:** Must support enough data, power and be capable of carrying a display signal. USB-C ports support that. You have to check with your computer manufacturer.&#x20;

**USB-C cable:** Must support enough data, power and be capable of carrying a display signal. USB-C ports support that. You have to check with your computer manufacturer. You manufacturer may sell a specific cable that they say should be used.

**Thunderbolt** - Both Thunderbolt 3 and Thunderbolt 4 cables and ports are capable of being used for this scenario. &#x20;

## Combinations I have personally tested and confirmed to work

**Computer tested**

* Surface Pro 8
* Computer port: I connected to the USB-C ports on the side of the Surface Pro 8 which support Thunderbolt 4.
* The computer is plugged into a Surface dock to provide power.

**Cables tested**

* CableMatters \[Intel Certified] 20Gps Thunderbolt 3 cable (6.6 ft) supporting 100W charging. ([amazon link](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01AS8U9KE))

**Cable end thickness**

* For the CableMatters Usb-C cable, the **cable ends are a little too thick** to be plugged into some ports.
* I had to remove some plastic from one of the ends to fit it into the tablets using a knife.&#x20;

* This plastic was tough to cut. I didn't do a very clean job but it **just barely** fits into the port - the fit is very snug and I should probably remove just a little more.
