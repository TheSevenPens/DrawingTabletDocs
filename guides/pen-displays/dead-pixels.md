# Dead pixels

## Frequency of occurrence

A dead pixel does occur on some small percentage of monitors and pen displays.

I have not seen it be super common on pen displays from any manufacturer. And none of my pen displays from Wacom, Huion, or XP-Pen have any dead pixels.

## Fixing

It MIGHT be possible to fix a dead pixel &#x20;

## Returning your tablet or getting a refund

Usually a single dead or pixel will not be enough to qualify for a return or refund.

If you have a lot of them or a cluster of them, then you have a case for a refund.

In either case there is no harm checking to see if you can return the product.
