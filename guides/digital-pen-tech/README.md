# Digital pen tech

## Overview

There are a lot of digital pen technologies out there. Drawing tablets use EMR but there are technologies that offer a similar feature set

## EMR&#x20;

Traditional drawing tablets ALL use **EMR (Electromagnetic Resonance)** More here: [**EMR**](emr/). It is also used prominently by some mobile devices such as Samsung Galaxy Tab S series tablets. We believe that EMR overall offers the best drawing experience.&#x20;

## NON-EMR

* **Active Electrostatic (AES)** - Used by many mobile devices. More here: [**AES**](aes.md)&#x20;
* **Apple Pencil tech** - Used only by Apple devices: More here: [**Apple Pencil tech**](apple-pencil-tech.md)  &#x20;
* **Microsoft Pen Protocol (MPP)** - Used by Microsoft surface devices and a few others: [**MPP**](mpp.md)&#x20;
* **N-Trig** - Used by some older Microsoft surface models
