# The drawing experience

## G**etting strokes right the first time**

With a **pen display** you can see exactly where the stroke is going to be. Many people who use pen displays say that they get the stroke right the first time.&#x20;

Some people feel that with a **pen tablet**, they would have to make the stroke several times to get it right and press undo to erase the mistakes.&#x20;

I would generally agree with these statements. When I want to do some line work faster than normal, I will often switch from a pen tablet to a pen display.

## Matching hand movements and drawing

With a **pen display**, things are natural. You see the pen in the same place the stroke is being drawn - just like a piece of paper.

One of the downsides to this is, your own hand and the pen will block your eyes from seeing the display - just like paper. The easy solution to this is to reposition your eyes or take advantage of the canvas zoom and rotation features of your drawing app.

With a **pen tablet**, you are looking at a monitor but drawing somewhere else with your hand. Fundamentally this is no different than using a mouse.&#x20;

Just like a mouse, the operating system and drawing programs will usually show the position of the pen on the canvas, so you will have some visual feedback of the position of the pen even if you are not drawing.

One advantage of this disconnect is that the pen and your hand do not block your visibility of what you are drawing. That is a nice convenience.

Still, some people struggle with the disconnect .Usually they can train themselves out of this within a complex of weeks. But some people just can't get used to it.

## Quality of art you can make

Some people worry that the quality of art they want to produce can only be produced by a pen display. You shouldn't let that worry you. People have been producing amazing art with pen tablets for decades. There are definitely some benefits to using a pen display, but the quality of art than can be made is not a factor.

## Matching aspect ratios

With a pen display, the active are and the screen have the same size. This means the pen will draw exactly where you see it draw.

With a pen tablet, the active area where you raw is separate from the monitor where you see the your strokes. Unless specifically configured in the driver, this will cause your strokes to be distorted. For example if you draw a circle on the tablet it will show up as an oval on the screen. It is easy to fix this problem in the driver. More here: [**match aspect ratios between pen tablets and monitors**](core-features/active-area-aspect-ratio.md).
