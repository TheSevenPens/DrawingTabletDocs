Tablet enthusiast Kuuube maintains a spreadsheet which provides an extensive list of information on Wacom tablets.

This really is an amazing spreadsheet and you won't find some of this information ANYWHERE else.

## Notes

* The top part of the spreadsheet covers consumer tablets
* The bottom part of the spreadsheet covers professional tablets
* The models are listed by **model identifier** (i.e. model number). If you want to see the **model name(s)** associated with that model hover over the model identifier and a small tooltip will appear with the model name(s).
* Some pens have information Kuuube has measured about the **pressure range**. So for some you will get a good idea about the **initial activation force**.
* **Compatible nibs** are listed
* **Compatible pens** are listed
