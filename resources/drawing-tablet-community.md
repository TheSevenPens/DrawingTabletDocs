# Drawing tablet community

## Overview

Community plays an important part in the overall experience of using a drawing tablet. Because the vast majority of people will get help and get their answers from other members of the community instead of the manufacturer. To that end it's useful to familiarize yourself with what communities exist.

## Reddit&#x20;

Reddit for many years now has been the home of many very active communities of drawing tablet users. Some of those community subreddits are listed below.

Keep in mind these are community-supported. And while you might occasionally see someone from the support team of a tablet brand, these subreddits are NOT official support channels.

## Brand-hosted communities

Tablet brands also host their own community sites. For drawing tablet brands you will typically find these communities are not very large and there aren't many people posting questions or solutions.

## What you find in online communities

In online communities on reddit you may notice that the vast majority of posts are complaints. Do not necessarily be concerned by this. It is true for any online community discussing any product. Most people only post when they have a problem. The completely satisfied users who don't have problems users rarely post about how good or seamless their experience has been.

However it is also true that online forums can be a great source to help you make choices about brands. For example, if you see a lot of questions/problems about a certain model, that should factor into your purchase decision.  &#x20;
