## What you find in online communities

In online communities on reddit you may notice that the vast majority of posts are complaints. Do not necessarily be concerned by this. It is true for any online community discussing any product. Most people only post when they have a problem. The completely satisfied users who don't have problems users rarely post about how good or seamless their experience has been.

However it is also true that online forums can be a great source to help you make choices about brands. For example, if you see a lot of questions/problems about a certain model, that should factor into your purchase decision.  &#x20;
