# Measuring hover height

To more accurately assess hover height, I 3D printed this small tool.

Essentially it is a staircase with each step 0.5mm taller than the previous.

Each step is 0.5mm

At every 1.0mm increment the step is labelled.

I used a digital caliper to measure the thickness of the steps and found it is relatively accurate within +/- 0.1 for each step.
