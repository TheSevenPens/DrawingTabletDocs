# Measuring hover height

## Overview

To more accurately assess hover height, I 3D printed this small tool.

Essentially it is a staircase with each step 0.5mm taller than the previous.

Each step is 0.5mm.&#x20;

At every 1.0mm increment the step is labelled.

I used a digital caliper to measure the thickness of the steps and found it is relatively accurate within +/- 0.1 for each step.

## Printing details

* Printer: Bambu X1C
* Nozzle: Bambu Lab X1 Carbon 0.4 nozzle
* Filament: Bambu Basic PLA
* Layer height: 0.2mm
* Initial layer height: 0.2mm
* Plate: Textured PEI Plate

## Accuracy

Because the layer height is 0.2mm:

* The whole number steps are very accurate
* The intermediate steps such as 1.5mm, 2.5mm are slightly thicker than they should be.

I measured the steps with a digital caliper and had these results:

* 1.0mm step = 1.04mm
* 1.5mm step -> 1.63mm
* 2.0mm step -> 2.04mm
* 2.5mm step -> 2.63mm
* 5.0mm step -> 5.04mm
* 5.5mm step -> 5.65mm
* 10.0mm step -> 10.04mm
* 10.5mm step -> 10.64mm

For the purposes of this testing, the accuracy is enough. I really only care abour being within +/- 0.25mm of the desired step height
