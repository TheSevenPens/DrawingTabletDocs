# Diagonal wobble testing

I measure diagonal wobble using a simple procedure

## Resources

**Template** - I built a standard 1000x1000 pixel PNG I use that has gridlines at every 100 pixels. A Python script generates these images.

**Ruler** - I use a simple plastic ruler. I do not use metal rulers because they might interfere with the EMR tech in the pen.

**Driver** - I use the latest manufacturer driver. For very old tablets that don't have recent drivers, I use OpenTabletDriver.

**Application** - I use Krita&#x20;

## Testing process

* For pen tablets, set the active area to a single display.
* For pen tablets, set the driver to match the aspect ratio of the tablet to the display.
* Set Krita zoom to 100%.
* Trace usually at least five 10cm lines at 45 degrees using the plastic ruler.&#x20;
  * Draw the line from the lower left to the upper right
  * Take 3 seconds to draw the line.
* Save as a PNG



&#x20;

These examples were created by creating a 4K image in Krita and drawing (roughly) a 10cm line over 3 seconds using a smooth plastic ruler.
