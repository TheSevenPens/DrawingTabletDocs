# Diagonal wobble testing

I measure diagonal wobble using a simple procedure

## Resources

**Template** - I built a standard 1000x1000 pixel PNG I use that has gridlines. These image was programmatically generated by a Python script.

**Ruler** - I use a simple plastic ruler. Metal rulers might interfere with the EMR tech in the pen.

**Driver** - where possible I use the latest manufacturer driver. For very old tablets I use OpenTabletDriver.

**Application** - I use Krita&#x20;

## Testing process

* If it is a pen tablet, I set the driver to match the aspect ratio of the tablet to the display I am using.
* I set the zoom to 100%.
* I trace usually at least 5 10cm lines at 45 degrees using the ruler. The time to draw the lines varies from 2 to 3 seconds.
* Then I save that PNG



&#x20;

These examples were created by creating a 4K image in Krita and drawing (roughly) a 10cm line over 3 seconds using a smooth plastic ruler.
