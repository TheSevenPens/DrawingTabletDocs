# VESA

## Overview

VESA is a standard for mounting displays on varies surfaces, stands, or arms.

It is relevant for pen displays because pen displays are essentially monitors, and many people want to mount them similarly to a monitor.

## Availability

Not all pen displays support VESA mounting

* 13" and smaller - very rare that they support VESA
* 16" - Most do not. But a few do.
* 20"+ - Very common. As far as I know almost all pen displays at 20" and larger support VESA.

## Implementation

Basically VESA support means there will be 4 holes in a rectangular pattern on the back of the pen display. The distance between the holes corresponds to how big/heavy a display it is intended to support.

The hole patterns are usually specified by the distance between the screens. For example: 100x100mm. These hole patterns also name names like "FDMI MIS-D" but nobody uses those names.

<table><thead><tr><th width="187">VESA Standard</th><th>Hole Pattern</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>FDMI MIS-B</td><td>50 x 20 mm</td></tr><tr><td>FDMI MIS-C</td><td>75 x 35 mm</td></tr><tr><td>FDMI MIS-D</td><td>75 x 75 or 100 x 100 mm</td></tr><tr><td>FDMI MIS-E</td><td>200 x 100 mm</td></tr><tr><td>FDMI MIS-F</td><td>200 mm increments</td></tr></tbody></table>

For pen displays, in my experience the most common pattern is 100x100mm.

## Screws

The different hole patterns use different screws. For 100x100mm pattern, the screws are M4 x 10 mm.
