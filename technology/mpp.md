# MPP

## Overview

**MPP (Microsoft Pen Protocol)** is pen tech invented by Microsoft. We believe this is also very similar to AES.

Originally Microsoft used a tech called N-TRIG in their Microsoft Surface devices, but switched to MPP.&#x20;

It is still used in many Microsoft Surface devices and a few other mobile products.
