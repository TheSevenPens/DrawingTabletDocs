# EMR pressure detection

## Pressure detection

In a video I published in 2022 ([**How do EMR pens work**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vv668I4LEdg)), a specific method to detect pressure is shown. This method involves moving the ferrite core which then alters the resonant frequency of the LC circuit. This design is from a very, very old EMR pen design.&#x20;

Modern designs use a separate pressure sensor which is more reliable for detecting pressure.

The OLD EMR pen design can be seen in [**this teardown of the Huion PEN80 pen**](../../guides/pens/pen-teardown-huion-pen80.md).
