# Huion pens

## PenTech

Huion uses the name "PenTech" for their EMR pen technology and even has version numbers to help it has evolved over the years.

The key changes are:

* Pentech 1.0 - NON-EMR. Pen has a replaceable battery.
* Pentech 1.1 - NON-EMR. Pen has a rechargeable battery
* Pentech 2.0 - EMR. Pen no longer has batter. Gets power from the tablet.
* Pentech 3.0 - EMR. Pressure now detected through a pressure sensor instead of relying on moving the ferrite core. This is a more reliable design and is how Wacom has been doing it for decades.
