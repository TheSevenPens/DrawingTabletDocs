# 7p notes: Huion and XP-Pen

## Tier 2: Huion and XP-Pen

**HUION** ([https://www.huion.com/](https://www.huion.com/)) and **XP-PEN** ([https://www.xp-pen.com/](https://www.xp-pen.com/)) are the next big tablet brands. Their recent (2021, 2022) models have been pretty good - but still trail Wacom a bit in quality and reliability. In general I think they offer 90% of what you get with a WACOM but at a substantial price reduction.&#x20;

Like Wacom they both have a wide variety of products available.

## What HUION and XP-PEN do well:

* Good price vs cost
* Their latest offerings since 2021 are very usable for creative tasks.
* They introduce new models frequently - much more often than Wacom.
* Their consumer level tablets tend to have more features than Wacom's consumer models (tilt &  tablet buttons, dials, knobs)

### How Huion and XP-PEN could do better

* Huion pen displays - especially the high PPI ones tend to show more AG sparkle. more here: [Anti-glare sparkle](../guides/pen-displays/anti-glare-sparkle.md).
* Pointer lag:
  * XP-pen pen displays tend to exhibit slightly more pointer lag than Wacom or Huion. More here: [lag](../guides/core-features/lag.md).&#x20;
  * XP-Pen and Huion's pen tablets seem to have the same level of pointer lag.&#x20;
* Improve their Core EMR tech and specs - while on paper equivalent to Wacom are still trailing. For many artists they may not notice this, but tablet enthusiasts do certainly notice it. (Will be a topic for a future video)
* Improve customer support. Both Huion and XP-Pen struggle with customer support. They tend to take more time to respond.&#x20;
* Reliability - Huion and XP-pen a little lag behind Wacom. &#x20;
* They offer too many products - with new models (with newer tech) and older models (with older tech) sitting alongside them. This makes it confusing to buyers.
* They should monitor and answer questions on [https://www.reddit.com/r/huion/](https://www.reddit.com/r/huion/) and [https://www.reddit.com/r/XPpen/](https://www.reddit.com/r/XPpen/) &#x20;
* Long-term reliability unknown compared to Wacom. This can't be helped, they have only been around since 2011 (Huion) and 2005 (XP-Pen). And their true EMR tablets (the ones where the pens do not have a battery) have only been around since the late 2010s.

## Survey of Huion users (2023)

In early 2023, reddit user Sunny-Throwaway (account now deleted) ran a survey on the Huion subreddit. There were 20 respondents and that is not a large sample size but it is interesting to look through.

* Reddit post about the results: ([https://www.reddit.com/r/huion/comments/11vbg9d/update\_huion\_tablet\_survey\_college\_project/](https://www.reddit.com/r/huion/comments/11vbg9d/update\_huion\_tablet\_survey\_college\_project/))
