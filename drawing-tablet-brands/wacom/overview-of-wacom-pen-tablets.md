# Overview of Wacom pen tablets

## Overview

If you are interested in a pen tablet (a drawing tablet without a screen) for drawing/sketching/painting and want to go with the "safe choice" then you should pick a Wacom tablet. In particular the Wacom Intuos Pro models identified here (PTH-860, PTH-660, PTH-460) are THE BEST PEN TABLETS EVER MADE.

Wacom has several separate lines of pen tablets. This document will help you understand the difference and help you make your choice.

## Wacom One GEN2 pen tablets

The Wacom One GEN2 pen are intended to be upgrades to the consumer-level Intuos tablets. Currently Wacom One GEN2 tablets seem to suffer from pressure issues and I do not recommend purchasing them. More here: [7P notes: Wacom One GEN2](../../product-info/wacom/wacom-one-gen2/7p-notes-wacom-one-gen2-drawing-tablets.md)&#x20;

## Recommendation summary

* **Sketching, digital painting, illustration**, etc. -&#x20;
  * If budget permits, get a Wacom Intuos Pro MEDIUM (PTH-660).&#x20;
  * If you tend do draw with larger gestures then consider a Wacom Intuos Pro LARGE (PTH-860).&#x20;
  * If you want to spend less get a One by Wacom MEDIUM (CTL-672) or a Intuos Medium (CTL-6100, CTL-6100WL)&#x20;
* **Photo-editing** - i.e. you aren't doing anything that requires "strokes" - then the One by Wacom SMALL (CTL-472) is fine.
* **Using the tablet as a mouse replacement** - i.e. you aren't doing anything that requires "strokes" but instead just clicking on things or dragging them - then the One by Wacom SMALL (CTL-472) is fine.
* **Taking notes**. I don't recommend pen tablets in general for taking notes. Use an alternative (like an iPad) instead. More here: [**Taking notes with drawing tablets**](../../guides/use-cases/taking-notes-with-drawing-tablets.md).&#x20;
* **Play Osu!** - One by Wacom SMALL (CTL-472) or One by Wacom SMALL MEDIUM (CTL-672) are the best choices. For more information regarding tablets for osu! and other tablet options consult [**Kuuube's tablet buying guide**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1DYVfiSpQqdpa4sWWYUALPmliOIuGyKog7B7LJJdmlhE/edit#gid=2077726645).&#x20;
* **Exploring drawing tablets** - this is if you are not sure if you are going to use a drawing tablet, but just want to dabble without spending a lot.&#x20;
  * Start with a One by Wacom SMALL (CTL-472) for general usage.&#x20;
  * Start with a One by Wacom MEDIUM (CTL-672) if you intend to draw on it.
* **Want the best and don't care about the cost.** Either:
  * Wacom Intuos Pro Large (PTH-860)
  * Wacom Intuos Pro Medium (PTH-660)
* **Picking the right size** - More information about picking the right size: [**tablet size**](../../guides/core-features/choosing-the-right-tablet-size.md).

## Pens

Each product line uses different pens. And the pens can only be used within that product line. For example if you try to use the LP190K pen with the PTH-860, the tablet does not even recognize there is a pen there. More here: [**Wacom pen compatibility**](wacom-pen-compatibility.md)&#x20;

<mark style="color:red;">REMEMBER: You cannot MIX AND MATCH these pens. For example, it is not possible to use the amazing Wacom Pro Pen 2 with the One by Wacom, Wacom Oner, or Intuos tablets.</mark>

Of the pens identified, the Wacom Pro Pen 2 is the best in terms of design, materials, shape, weight distribution.&#x20;

## Pen pressure

Learn more here: [**Pen pressure**](../../guides/core-features/pen-pressure.md) &#x20;

2048 **pressure levels** is all you need for creative work. All of these pens are enough in that regard. Wacom has strong marketing towards their higher pressure level tablets, but the vast majority of users will not be able to make use of these higher levels in their work.&#x20;

More than pressure levels, the **pressure range** has a greater impact on your drawing experience. And this is driven by the quality of the pressure sensor in the pen. &#x20;

**Pens compared**&#x20;

Min pressure and max pressure measurements independently made by [Kuuube](../../resources/kuuube/).

<table><thead><tr><th>Pen</th><th width="144">levels</th><th width="176">min pressure (IAF)</th><th>max pressure</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Wacom Pen 2K (LP-190K)</td><td>2048</td><td>&#x3C;1gf</td><td>320gf</td></tr><tr><td>Wacom One Pen GEN2 (CP-923) </td><td>4096</td><td>&#x3C;8gf</td><td>291gf</td></tr><tr><td>Wacom Pen 4K (LP-1100K)</td><td>4096</td><td>&#x3C;1gf</td><td>226gf</td></tr><tr><td>Wacom Pro Pen 2 (KP-504E) </td><td>8192 </td><td>&#x3C;1gf</td><td>794gf</td></tr></tbody></table>

## Pen Tilt

Only some of Wacom pen tablets support tilt.&#x20;

* One by Wacom -> no tilt
* Wacom One GEN2 -> supports tilt
* Intuos -> no tilt
* Intuos Pro -> supports tilt

Not all drawing styles require tilt. And if you do want to control the rotation of your brush many drawing apps let you control the brush rotation based on the direction of the pen movement instead of tilt. Lean more here: [**Pen tilt**](../../guides/core-features/pen-tilt.md)&#x20;

## Tablet resolution

Resolution means how many separate points the tablet can distinguish (i.e. resolve) in a given length. This is specified as Lines Per Inch (LPI) though it is also useful to think about it as lines per millimeter (LPMM)

You will not notice the difference between 2048 LPI and 5080 LPI.

* One by Wacom -> 2048 LPI = 80.62 LPMM
* Wacom One GEN2 = Unknown
* Intuos -> 2540 LPI = 100 LPMM
* Intuos Pro -> 5080 LPI = 200 LPMM&#x20;

## Accuracy

Accuracy = tablet & computer know the correct position of the tip of the pen. As far as I have observed, all three tablets are very accurate.

## Pointer lag&#x20;

Pointer lag is the difference between the physical position of the pen and where the operating system pointer is drawn. Pen tablets in general display very little pointer lag. In comparison, all pen displays all show very noticeable lag.

* One by Wacom -> almost no pointer lag
* Wacom One GEN2 -> almost no pointer lag
* Intuos -> almost no pointer lag (has a extra lag due to position smoothing on hover)
* Intuos Pro -> almost no pointer lag

Learn more here: [**Lag**](../../guides/core-features/lag.md) &#x20;

## Accuracy / Diagonal wobble

The Intuos Pro models exhibit less wobble than the Intuos of One by Wacom. But all three are acceptable.&#x20;

## Position smoothing

Position smoothing can cause extra pointer lag.&#x20;

* One by Wacom -> no hardware smoothing
* Wacom One GEN2 -> unknown
* Intuos -> no hardware smoothing when drawing/dragging. hardware smoothing on hover.
* Intuos Pro -> no hardware smoothing

## Wireless/Bluetooth

* One by Wacom -> does NOT support wireless
* Wacom One GEN2 -> these pen tablets all support wirless via Bluetooth
* Intuos -> The models with WL in their name support wireless via Bluetooth
* Intuos Pro -> all models support wireless via Bluetooth

## USB port on tablet

The consumer series use older USB ports than the professional series.

* One by Wacom -> Micro USB B
* Wacom One GEN2 -> USB-C
* Intuos -> Micro USB B
* Intuos Pro -> USB-C

## ExpressKeys

<table><thead><tr><th width="194">Tablet series</th><th>ExpressKeys available</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>One by Wacom</td><td>No ExpressKeys</td></tr><tr><td>Wacom One GEN2</td><td>No ExpressKeys</td></tr><tr><td>Intuos</td><td>4 at the top</td></tr><tr><td>Intuos Pro</td><td>8 on the left </td></tr></tbody></table>

## Touch support

Only some of the tablets support touch:

* Intuos Pro Large
* Intuos Pro Medium
* Intuos Pro Small
* Wacom One 13 touch GEN2

For these tablets, touch can be enabled/disabled with a physical switch on the side of the tablet.

**How good is the touch support?**

In my opinion the touch support is not great. The touch pad on any laptop you use will be far better and more responsive. Also the touch support has poor palm rejection. Disabling touch is the first thing I do with an tablet that supports it.

Touch works much better on Window systems than on Macs. This is not Wacom's fault, it is due to how well Windows supports touch compared to MacOS.

## Tablet design

With the Intuos Pro tablets and pens - everything feels great to me. The texture the weight of the pen, etc.

The One by Wacom, Wacom ONE GEN2, and Intuos models feel a more plasticy/cheaper. Also I just don't enjoy how their pens feel in my hand.&#x20;

## Active Area

The size of the tablet is based on it's active area which is the region on the tablet that is sensitive to the EMR pen. Besides the height and width of this area it is also convenient to discuss them in terms of their diagonal lengths.

**Aspect Ratio**: Most monitors are 16:9 (1.78) or 16:10 (1.60) If the Aspect Ratio of the tablet does not match the monitor, that means your strokes will be slightly distorted. <mark style="color:red;">So, remember to enable the</mark> <mark style="color:red;"></mark><mark style="color:red;">**Force Proportions**</mark> <mark style="color:red;"></mark><mark style="color:red;">checkbox to have undistorted strokes</mark>.

## Reliability

All of these are very reliable tablets. Their pens are also very reliable. **But remember, DO NOT drop your pens.** they are much more delicate than the tablets and you can break from a fall.&#x20;

## Drivers

The same Wacom driver works with all three product lines.

## Surface texture

The Intuos Pro has a more textured surface, the Intuos and One by Wacom have less texture.

**Intuos Pro texture**

The Intuos Pro MEDIUM and LARGE models have a surface that is replaceable with a **Texture Sheet**.Wacom has three kinds of texture sheets: Standard, Smooth, and Rough. These texture sheets are often sold out and the smooth one is EXTREMELY rare. Besides giving you the texture feeling you want, they are useful if you've scratched up the surface of your tablet and want to make it feel like new.   &#x20;

## Nib wear

The Intuos Pro series has a slightly more textured surface than the other models.

A result of this texture is that - depending how you draw - you can wear down a nib very fast. If you are doing a lot of shading with many back and forth strokes you might even notice significant wear within a week or even a day.

In any case, I advise everyone to always pay attention to their nibs and replace them if they are getting very worn.

## Future versions

**Intuos**

In August of 2023, The Intuos models seem to be replaced by the One by Wacom GEN2 pen tablets.

**One by Wacom**

No sign of any udpates coming

**Intuos Pro**

Having said that since Wacom has upgraded its professional Cintiq line of pen displays in late 2022, there is a natural expectation that updates to their Intuos Pro pen tablets may be coming. Wacom has unfortunately not signaled anything about new Intuos Pro pen tablet products.

## Notes on pen tablet models

### Intuos Pro

There are two Intuos Pro generations and unfortunately the have the same name "Intuos Pro". So if you are purchasing an Intuos Pro you really need to pay attention to the model numbers.

* The current generation (sometimes referred to as "GEN2")
  * Intuos Pro Small (PTH-460) -> 2019
  * Intuos Pro Medium (PTH-660) -> 2017
  * Intuos Pro Large (PTH-860) -> 2017
* The older generation (sometimes referred to as "GEN1")
  * Intuos Pro Large (PTH-851) -> 2013
  * Intuos Pro Medium (PTH-651) -> 2013
  * Intuos Pro Small (PTH-451) -> 2013

## Notes on older Wacom tablets series

* The **Wacom Bamboo** series has now been renamed to the **One by Wacom** series

## Distinguishing physical features

* the One by Wacom has a bright red back
* the One by Wacom has a fabric pen holder on the side of the tablet
* The Intuos in available in several colors for the back plastic
* The Intuos has a fabric pen holder on the top of the tablet
* The Intuos Pro is always black both front and back
* The Intuos Pro has no fabric pen holder
* The Intuos Pro has a circular dial on the left of the tablet.

## Understanding the model numbers

### Consumer vs Professional

The first letter to indicates if the tablet is a consumer of professional model. C means consumer. P means professional

* C -> Consumer (example: **C**TL-472)
* P -> Professional (example: **P**TH-660)

### Active area size

The first digit of the number Indicates the active area size of the tablet

* 4 -> small (example: CTL-**4**72)
* 6 -> medium (example: CTL-**6**100WL)
* 8 -> large (example: PTH-**8**60)&#x20;
