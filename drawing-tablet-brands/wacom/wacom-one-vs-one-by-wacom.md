# Wacom One vs One by Wacom

If you are new to Wacom, you should understand this issue because it is a constant source of confusion for people looking to buy a Wacom tablet, get help with a Wacom tablet, or buy a replacement pen for their Wacom tablet.

The problem: Wacom makes two very different devices with confusingly similar names:

* **One by Wacom** (CTL-472 and CTL-672) - a series of entry-level consumer pen tablets (without a screen)
* **Wacom One** (DTC-133) - an entry-level consumer pen display (that does have a screen).

A **One by Wacom** looks like this (it does not have a screen):

A **Wacom One** looks like this (it has a screen):
