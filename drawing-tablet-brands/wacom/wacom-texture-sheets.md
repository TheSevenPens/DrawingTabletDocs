# Wacom texture sheets

## Overview

For their Intuos Pro line of pen tablets, Wacom sells several texture sheets that replace the texture that came with the tablets

## Tablet compatibility

These texture sheets are available for these models:

* Wacom Intuos Pro Large&#x20;
* Wacom Intuos Pro Medium

## Texture types

They come in three texture variations:

* Standard <- this is what the Intuos Pro models use out-of-the-box&#x20;
* Rough
* Smooth

## Benefits

These texture sheets have two benefits:

* If you have damaged the surface of your tablet, you can restore it to brand new condition
* If you simply prefer a different texture feel

## Availability

Unfortunately these texture sheets are often out of stock and are very hard to find these days. The smooth texture sheet in particular is a rare item.

## Installation

Here's an example of how to install a texture sheet:&#x20;
