# Drawing tablet brands vs digitizers

All drawing tablets have multiple components, but the primary component is the EMR sensor - which also called the **digitizer**.

And despite all the many brands of drawing tablets you see, there are only a couple of manufacturers of digitizers. These are:

* **Wacom**
  * Wacom digitizers are used in their own products.
* **Hanvon Ugee**
  * Supplies digitizers for: Xencelabs and XP-pen tablets
* **Huion**&#x20;
  * Supplies digitizers for: Gaomon, Huion, Veikk tablets. And for Artisul tablets through their acquisition of UCLogic.
  * Huion acquired UCLogic in 2019 ([https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/UC-Logic\_Technology\_Corp.](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/UC-Logic\_Technology\_Corp.))
