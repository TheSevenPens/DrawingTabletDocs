# 7P notes: Xencelabs

## Overview

Xencelabs ([https://www.xencelabs.com/](https://www.xencelabs.com/)) is trying to position itself as a direct competitor to Wacom - as you can see from the pricing of their products.

They are a very new brand and have a small product line as of Jan 2024:

* Xencelabs Pen Display 24: [<mark style="background-color:green;">**my notes on this tablet**</mark>](../product-info/xencelabs/7p-notes-xencelabs-lph2412u-a.md)
* Xencelabs Pen Display 16: [<mark style="background-color:green;">**my notes on this tablet**</mark>](../product-info/xencelabs/7p-notes-xencelabs-lph1612u-a.md)
* Xencelabs Pen Tablet Medium: [<mark style="background-color:green;">**my notes on this tablet**</mark>](../product-info/xencelabs/7p-notes-xencelabs-bph1212w-a.md)  (very minimal notes)
* Xencelabs Pen Tablet Small

### What Xencelabs does well

* They are very thoughtful about the design of their products. You can see small touches that make a difference. For example:
  * Their pen tablets are exactly 16x9 aspect ratio
  * The front edge of their pen tablets are slightly slopped so there's less of a hard edge hitting your wrist
* The "feel" and quality of materials is excellent - Wacom tier.
* Their driver experience is easily the most well thought-out, user-friendly and attractive of any tablet brand.
* Their tablets come with 2 pens. This is great because if you are having difficulties you se if switching pens helps.
* I don't have any direct experience with their support. I haven't needed to contact them for any issue. But from what I have seen Xencelabs support is extremely good.

### How Xencelabs could do better

* Their EMR tech is the same place as XP-Pen. If they are going to challenge Wacom at the same price point this should improve.&#x20;
* There aren't that many Xencelabs users out there - so if you need community help there are very few people in the community who can help and you'll need to rely Xencelab's customer support.
* As of July 2024 they have a wider product portfolio . The only gap i see is that they don't have a LARGE pen tablet model - something comparable to the Wacom Intuos Pro Large.
