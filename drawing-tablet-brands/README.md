# Drawing tablet brands

## Introduction&#x20;

There are many tablet brands. And picking the brand of the tablet is one of the most important decisions you will need to make.

Notes:

* I covered brands extensively in this video in late 2023: [https://youtu.be/kw7fKQik3YY](https://youtu.be/kw7fKQik3YY)&#x20;
* If you are not familiar with drawing tablets, please read the [Beginner's guide to drawing tablets](../guides/beginners-guide.md)

## Simplified history

* **1980 - 2000 -** Wacom (founded 1983). Wacom brings the EMR technology to drawing tablets.
* **2000 - 2020 -** Other tablet brands started appearing in the 2000s (Huion: 2011, XP-Pen: 2005). For a long time these brands lagged behind Wacomâ€™s technology because Wacom held the core patents for drawing tablets.
* **2010 - 2020 -** Eventually Wacom patents expired (by \~2010?) and then other brands could then use EMR technology to provide the full battery-free experience.
* **2020 - now -** There are a lot of tablet brands but Wacom still reigns. Xencelabs (founded in 2019) entered the market and specifically targets professional creative users.&#x20;

## Current state of the market (2024)

* **Wacom** continues to make the highest quality and most reliable tablets. But also they are the most expensive
  * Wacom's pro line of pen tablets (Intuos pro) continue to be the best pen tablets ever made
  * Wacom's pro line of pen displays (Cintiq pro) continue to be the best pen displays ever made
* **Huion and XP-pen** since about 2021 have been releasing solid devices
  * And although they have a large lineup of products that can be a little confusing
  * In 2023 and 2024 Huion and XP have released models with upgraded tech that are challenging Wacom's professional line. These include:
    * Huion:Kamvas Pro 19, Kamvas Pro 27
    * XP-Pen: Deco Pro GEN2, Artist Pro GEN2
* **Xencelabs** (founded 2019) is a new brand focused only on professional tablets and have a very strong focus on customer support.
* **Others -** After Wacom, Huion, XP-Pen, there are many other brands that focus on budget or consumer tablets.&#x20;

## Customer support

No brand's products are consistently perfect.&#x20;

All brands will eventually ship a product that has defective units or that will have sporadic problems with their drivers, etc. So, at some point you will need help.

This is why you MUST choose a brand that:

* Supports its customers well
* Has enough other people using their tablets, so that you can get help from the community.&#x20;

## Tiers

I segment the brands into tiers, to make it easier to steer people to help set expectations and guide recommendations.

**Tier 1** is currently just one brand, Wacom. Most of their products are excellent with some exceptions. Best drawing experience. I consider them a safe choice. More here:  [**my notes on wacom**](7p-notes-wacom.md)

**Tier 2** trails Wacom in tech. Customer support is also trailing but improving. Community is large so you can find help from others. Large porfolio of tablets - too large actually. Research your choice and you should find something that works well for you. Drawing experience good, typically you may find you need to perform more customization (pressure curves, etc.) to get the drawing experience that works for you.  More here: [**My notes on Tier 2 drawing tablet brands**](7p-notes-tier-2-drawing-tablet-brands.md) &#x20;

**Tier 3** - All these brands the same technology as the Tier 2 brands. In fact they are even owned by the same companies. But have smaller portfolios, less responsive customer support, and smaller communities.&#x20;

* Xencelabs - [https://www.xencelabs.com/us](https://www.xencelabs.com/us) ([**my notes on xencelabs**](7p-notes-xencelabs.md))
* Artisul - [https://artisul.com/](https://artisul.com/)
* Gaomon - [https://www.gaomon.net/](https://www.gaomon.net/)&#x20;
* Ugee - [https://www.ugee.com/](https://www.ugee.com/)

**Tier 4** - Very small portfolios. Don't have much information on these brands.

* Veikk - [https://www.veikk.com/](https://www.veikk.com/)
* Parblo&#x20;

**Tier 5** - Everyone else. Avoid.&#x20;

## Digitizers vs brands

All drawing tablets have multiple components, but the primary component is the EMR sensor - which also called the **digitizer**.

And despite all the many brands of drawing tablets you see, there are only a couple of manufacturers of digitizers. These are:

* **Wacom**
  * Wacom digitizers are used in their own products.
* **Hanvon Ugee**
  * Supplies digitizers for: Xencelabs and XP-pen tablets
* **Huion**&#x20;
  * Supplies digitizers for: Gaomon, Huion, Veikk tablets. And for Artisul tablets through their acquisition of UCLogic.
  * Huion acquired UCLogic in 2019 ([https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/UC-Logic\_Technology\_Corp.](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/UC-Logic\_Technology\_Corp.))

## Online communities

Communities are where a people can learn and get help with drawing tablets. Depending on the brand there are different options. More here: [**Drawing tablet communities**](../resources/drawing-tablet-communities.md)  &#x20;
