## **Tier 1: Wacom**

**Wacom** continues to make the highest quality and most reliable tablets. In general, Wacom has tghe best drawing experience. Their products are the most expensive. I consider Wacom to be the "safe choice". More here:  [**my notes on Wacom**](7p-notes-wacom.md)

## Tier 2: Huion and XP-Pen

**Huion and XP-pen** since about 2021 have been releasing decent devices and size 2023/2024 a couple very good ones that compete strongly with Wacom. In many ways they deliver 90% of what a typical person needs for about half the cost. They do trail Wacom in reliability and in customer support however. If you carefully research a tablet from these brands, you can find one that works for you. More here: [**My notes on Tier 2 drawing tablet brands**](7p-notes-tier-2-drawing-tablet-brands.md) &#x20;

## Tier 2: Xencelabs

**Xencelabs** (founded 2019) is a new brand focused only on professional tablets and have a very strong focus on customer support. more here: [**my notes on Xencelabs**](7p-notes-xencelabs.md)

## Tier 3: Smaller brands

After Wacom, Huion, XP-Pen, there are many other brands that focus on budget or consumer tablets. All these brands the same technology as the Tier 2 brands. In fact they are even owned by the same companies. But have smaller portfolios, less responsive customer support, and smaller communities.&#x20;

## Customer support

No brand's products are consistently perfect.&#x20;

All brands will eventually ship a product that has defective units or that will have sporadic problems with their drivers, etc. So, at some point you will need help.

This is why you MUST choose a brand that:

* Supports its customers well
* Has enough other people using their tablets, so that you can get help from the community.&#x20;

## Online communities

Communities are where a people can learn and get help with drawing tablets. Depending on the brand there are different options. More here: [**Drawing tablet communities**](../resources/drawing-tablet-community.md)  &#x20;
