# Drawing tablet brands

## Introduction&#x20;

There are many tablet brands. And picking the brand of the tablet is one of the most important decisions you will need to make.

## Pre-reading

If you are here you may be new to drawing tablets or may want to purchase one. These two guides will help you:

* [Buying a drawing tablet](../buying-a-drawing-tablet/)

## History

Wacom has been the leading tablet brand for decades. And for a long time they were essentially the only tablet brand because Wacom invented the EMR technology that is used in drawing tablets back in the 1980s.

Other tablet brands started appearing in the 2000s

* Huion founded in 2011
* XP-Pen founded in 2005
* and there are many others

For a long time these brands lagged behind Wacomâ€™s technology. For example, they would often have pens that required a battery whereas all of Wacom's pens have always been batteryless - And instead get their power from just being close to the tablet. The reason these other tablet brands lagged behind for a while was very simple: Wacom held the core patents for drawing tablets. Eventually those patents expired (before 2010 if I recall correctly) and these other brands could then use EMR technology.&#x20;

## Current state of the market (2023)

* **Wacom** continues to make the highest quality and most reliable tablets. But also they are the most expensive
  * Wacom's pro line of pen tablets (intuos pro) continue to be the best pen tablets ever made
  * Wacom's pro line of pen displays (cintiq pro) continue to be the best pen displays ever made
* **Huion and XP** pen since about 2021 have been releasing some really solid devices
  * And although they have a large lineup of products that can be a little confusing
  * And if you're looking at their very latest tablets that are being released in 2022 or 2023 - these very latest models are especially strong contenders both in the consumer and in the professional space. And they tend to costs much less.
* **Xencelabs** (founded 2019) is a new brand focused only on professional tablets and have a very strong focus on customer support.&#x20;
* And after those four brands there are many others that seem to focus more on budget consumer offerings.

## Feature availability

One thing you'll notice about Wacom is that they tend to keep certain features in their professional line of products. In fact over time they have tended to remove features from their consumer tablets and move them only to the pro line. Other manufacturers tend to have the same features on consumer and professional lines.

## Support

No brand's products are consistently perfect.&#x20;

All brands will eventually ship a product that has defective units or that will have sporadic problems with their drivers, etc. So, at some point you will need help.

This is why you MUST choose a brand that:

* Supports its customers well
* has enough other people using their tablets, so that you can get help from the community.&#x20;

## Tier 1: Wacom

The leading brand out there is **Wacom** ([https://www.wacom.com](https://www.wacom.com)). They have a variety of products and different price points that should fit everyone's needs. If you don't want to weigh the pros and cons of different brands and want an easy answer then choose Wacom.&#x20;

My experience: I currently own 19 Wacom tablets (2 pen displays and 17 pen tablets). I have extensively used a tablet from every professional Intuos series.&#x20;

### What Wacom does well

* Best EMR tech. This may not be obvious just by comparing specs, but their EMR tablet technology is ahead.&#x20;
* Long-term reliability. Their older tablets (20+ years old) still work today if you use the appropriate driver.
* They have products for beginners, intermediate users, and professionals - but even their beginner products are very high quality.
* They have good support.&#x20;
* They monitor and respond to questions on [https://www.reddit.com/r/wacom](https://www.reddit.com/r/wacom)&#x20;

### How Wacom could do better

* Introduce new models. The product line has not significantly advanced in a few years.
* More competitive pricing. Competitors are encroaching on Wacom space and gaining traction in features and reliability. The price premium Wacom commands for their professional products is starting to feel like like too much of a tax.
* Straighten out their product naming. Specifically their **One by Wacom** pen tablet has a name too similar to their **Wacom One** pen display.

## Tier 2: Huion and XP-Pen

**HUION** ([https://www.huion.com/](https://www.huion.com/)) and **XP-PEN** ([https://www.xp-pen.com/](https://www.xp-pen.com/)) are the next big tablet brands. Their recent (2021, 2022) models have been pretty good - but still trail Wacom a bit in quality and reliability. In general I think they offer 90% of what you get with a WACOM but at a substantial price reduction.&#x20;

Like Wacom they both have a wide variety of products available.

## What HUION and XP-PEN do well:

* Good price vs cost
* Their latest offerings since 2021 are very usable for creative tasks.
* They introduce new models frequently - much more often than Wacom.
* Their consumer level tablets tend to have more features than Wacom's consumer models (tilt &  tablet buttons, dials, knobs)

### How Huion and XP-PEN could do better

* Huion pen displays - especially the high PPI ones tend to show more AG sparkle. more here: [Anti-glare sparkle](../guides/pen-displays/anti-glare-sparkle.md).
* XP-pen tablets tend to exhibit slightly more pointer lag than Wacom or Huion. More here: [lag](../guides/core-features/lag.md).
* Improve their Core EMR tech and specs - while on paper equivalent to Wacom are still trailing. For many artists they may not notice this, but tablet enthusiasts do certainly notice it. (Will be a topic for a future video)
* Improve customer support. Both Huion and XP-Pen struggle with customer support. They tend to take more time to respond.&#x20;
* Reliability - Huion and XP-pen a little lag behind Wacom. &#x20;
* They offer too many products - with new models (with newer tech) and older models (with older tech) sitting alongside them. This makes it confusing to buyers.
* They should monitor and answer questions on [https://www.reddit.com/r/huion/](https://www.reddit.com/r/huion/) and [https://www.reddit.com/r/XPpen/](https://www.reddit.com/r/XPpen/) &#x20;
* Long-term reliability unknown compared to Wacom. This can't be helped, they have only been around since 2011 (Huion) and 2005 (XP-Pen). And their true EMR tablets (the ones where the pens do not have a battery) have only been around since the late 2010s.

### Tablets I own:

* 3 Huion pen displays
* 4 Huion pen tablets
* 2 XP-Pen pen displays
* 1 XP-Pen pen tablet

All my Huion and XP-Pen tablets have worked well since I had them.

My experience with Huion tablets: [Notes on using Huion tablets](broken-reference)

## Survey of Huion users (2023)

In early 2023, reddit user Sunny-Throwaway ran a survey on the Huion subreddit. There were 20 respondents and that is not a large sample size but it is interesting to look through.

Reddit post about the results: ([https://www.reddit.com/r/huion/comments/11vbg9d/update\_huion\_tablet\_survey\_college\_project/](https://www.reddit.com/r/huion/comments/11vbg9d/update\_huion\_tablet\_survey\_college\_project/))

Direct link to the results: [https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1wWcAHNYmea94cAF-rjdNrQWVg28pXJrIHqp1Del4jSY/viewanalytics](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1wWcAHNYmea94cAF-rjdNrQWVg28pXJrIHqp1Del4jSY/viewanalytics)&#x20;

## Tier 2: Xencelabs

Xencelabs ([https://www.xencelabs.com/](https://www.xencelabs.com/)) is trying to position itself as a direct competitor to Wacom - as you can see from the pricing of their products.

They are a very new company so currently have a limited product line of 2 pen tablets, and 1 pen display coming out in 2023.

I used a Xencelabs Medium tablet (BPH1212W-A) for about six months. I was very satisfied with it for doing artwork. &#x20;

### What Xencelabs does well

* They are very thoughtful about the design of their products. You can see small touches that make a difference. For example:
  * Their pen tablets are exactly 16x9 aspect ratio
  * The front edge of their pen tablets are slightly slopped so there's less of a hard edge hitting your wrist
* The "feel" and quality of materials is excellent - Wacom tier.
* Their driver experience is easily the most user-friendly and attractive of any tablet brand.
* I don't have any direct experience with their support. I haven't needed to contact them for any issue.

### How Xencelabs could do better

* Their EMR tech is the same place as XP-Pen. If they are going to challenge Wacom at the same price point this should improve.&#x20;
* There aren't that many Xencelabs users out there - so if you need community help there are very few people in the community who can help.

## Tier 3: The small players

I don't recommend tier 3 brands. They just don't have much presence in market and the customer support is lacking.&#x20;

Included brands:

* Artisul - [https://artisul.com/](https://artisul.com/)
* Gaomon - [https://www.gaomon.net/](https://www.gaomon.net/)
* Parblo - [https://www.parblo.com/](https://www.parblo.com/)
* Ugee - [https://www.ugee.com/](https://www.ugee.com/)
* Veikk - [https://www.veikk.com/](https://www.veikk.com/)

## Tier 4: Every other brand

Save yourself problems and avoid any tier 4 products.&#x20;

## Digitizers vs brands

All drawing tablets have multiple components, but the primary component is the EMR sensor - which also called the **digitizer**.

And despite all the many brands of drawing tablets you see, there are only a couple of manufacturers of digitizers. These are:

* Wacom
* UGEE
* UCLogic ([https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/UC-Logic\_Technology\_Corp.](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/UC-Logic\_Technology\_Corp.))

**Wacom digitizers** are used in only Wacom tablets. These are the best digitizers.

**Ugee digitizers** are used in Xencelabs and XP-pen tablets

**UCLogic digitizers** are used in Gaomon, Huion, Veikk, and Parblo tablets.

## Online community forums

There are some active online forums for drawing tablets such as various subreddits such as:

* [https://www.reddit.com/r/wacom/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wacom/)
* [https://www.reddit.com/r/huion/](https://www.reddit.com/r/huion/)&#x20;
* [https://www.reddit.com/r/XPpen/](https://www.reddit.com/r/XPpen/) &#x20;
* [https://www.reddit.com/r/xencelabs/](https://www.reddit.com/r/xencelabs/)

In online communities reddit you may notice that the vast majority of posts are complaints. Do not necessarily be concerned by this. It is true for any online community discussing any product. Most people only post when they have a problem. The completely satisfied users who don't have problems users rarely post about how good or seamless their experience has been.

However it is also true that online forums can be a great source to help you make choices about brands. For example, if you see a lot of questions/problems about a certain model, that should factor into your purchase decision.  &#x20;

## Notes

* In general I would recommend the S tier and A tier for doing artwork. Of course specific tablet models have their strengths and weakness, so don't rely on the brand name as the only factor for a purchase decision.
* What differentiates the A tier from the B tier? The customer support experience and the ability to get answers and help from others users in online communities.
