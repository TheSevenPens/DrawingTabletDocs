# Drawing tablet brands

## Introduction&#x20;

There are many tablet brands. And picking the brand of the tablet is one of the most important decisions you will need to make.

I covered brands extensively in this video: [https://youtu.be/kw7fKQik3YY](https://youtu.be/kw7fKQik3YY)&#x20;

## Pre-reading

If you are here you may be new to drawing tablets or may want to purchase one. These two guides will help you:

* [Buying a drawing tablet](../buying-a-drawing-tablet/)

## History

Wacom has been the leading tablet brand for decades. And for a long time they were essentially the only tablet brand because Wacom invented the EMR technology that is used in drawing tablets back in the 1980s.

Other tablet brands started appearing in the 2000s

* Huion founded in 2011
* XP-Pen founded in 2005

For a long time these brands lagged behind Wacomâ€™s technology. For example, they would often have pens that required a battery whereas all of Wacom's pens have always been batteryless - And instead get their power from just being close to the tablet. The reason these other tablet brands lagged behind for a while was very simple: Wacom held the core patents for drawing tablets. Eventually those patents expired (before 2010 if I recall correctly) and these other brands could then use EMR technology.&#x20;

## Current state of the market (2023)

* **Wacom** continues to make the highest quality and most reliable tablets. But also they are the most expensive
  * Wacom's pro line of pen tablets (Intuos pro) continue to be the best pen tablets ever made
  * Wacom's pro line of pen displays (Cintiq pro) continue to be the best pen displays ever made
* **Huion and XP-pen** since about 2021 have been releasing some really solid devices
  * And although they have a large lineup of products that can be a little confusing
  * And if you're looking at their very latest tablets that are being released in 2022 or 2023 - these very latest models are especially strong contenders both in the consumer and in the professional space. And they tend to costs much less.
* **Xencelabs** (founded 2019) is a new brand focused only on professional tablets and have a very strong focus on customer support.&#x20;
* And after those four brands there are many others that seem to focus more on budget consumer offerings.

## Feature availability

One thing you'll notice about Wacom is that they tend to keep certain features in their professional line of products. In fact over time they have tended to remove features from their consumer tablets and move them only to the pro line. Other manufacturers tend to have those features consumer and professional lines.

## Support

No brand's products are consistently perfect.&#x20;

All brands will eventually ship a product that has defective units or that will have sporadic problems with their drivers, etc. So, at some point you will need help.

This is why you MUST choose a brand that:

* Supports its customers well
* Has enough other people using their tablets, so that you can get help from the community.&#x20;

## Tiers

I segment the brands into tiers, to make it easier to steer people to help set expectations and guide recommendations.

**Tier 1** is currently just one brand, Wacom. Most of their products are excellent with some exceptions. Best drawing experience. I consider them a safe choice.&#x20;

* Wacom - [https://www.wacom.com/](https://www.wacom.com/) ([**my notes on wacom**](7p-notes-wacom.md))

**Tier 2** trails Wacom in tech. Customer support is also trailing but improving. Community is large so you can find help from others. Large porfolio of tablets - too large actually. Research your choice and you should find something that works well for you. Drawing experience good, typically you may find you need to perform more customization (pressure curves, etc.) to get the drawing experience that works for you. &#x20;

[**My notes on Huion and Xencelabs**](7p-notes-huion-and-xp-pen.md)&#x20;

* Huion - [https://huion.com/](https://huion.com/)&#x20;
* XP-Pen - [https://www.xp-pen.com/](https://www.xp-pen.com/)&#x20;

**Tier 3** - All these brands the same technology as the Tier 2 brands. In fact they are even owned by the same companies. But have smaller portfolios, less responsive customer support, and smaller communities.&#x20;

* Xencelabs - [https://www.xencelabs.com/us](https://www.xencelabs.com/us) ([**my notes on xencelabs**](7p-notes-xencelabs.md))
* Artisul - [https://artisul.com/](https://artisul.com/)
* Gaomon - [https://www.gaomon.net/](https://www.gaomon.net/)&#x20;
* Ugee - [https://www.ugee.com/](https://www.ugee.com/)

**Tier 4** - Very small portfolios. Don't have much information on these brands.

* Veikk - [https://www.veikk.com/](https://www.veikk.com/)
* Parblo&#x20;

**Tier 5** - Everyone else. Avoid&#x20;

## Digitizers vs brands

All drawing tablets have multiple components, but the primary component is the EMR sensor - which also called the **digitizer**.

And despite all the many brands of drawing tablets you see, there are only a couple of manufacturers of digitizers. These are:

* Wacom
* Hanvon Ugee
* Huion (and UCLogic)
  * UCLogic ([https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/UC-Logic\_Technology\_Corp.](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/UC-Logic\_Technology\_Corp.))

**Wacom digitizers** are used in only Wacom tablets. These are the best digitizers.

**Ugee digitizers** are used in Xencelabs and XP-pen tablets

**Huion digitizers** are used in Gaomon, Huion, Veikk, and Parblo tablets.

**UCLogic digitizers** are used in Artisul tablets.

## Online community forums

There are some active online forums for drawing tablets such as various subreddits such as:

* [https://www.reddit.com/r/wacom/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wacom/)
* [https://www.reddit.com/r/huion/](https://www.reddit.com/r/huion/)&#x20;
* [https://www.reddit.com/r/XPpen/](https://www.reddit.com/r/XPpen/) &#x20;
* [https://www.reddit.com/r/xencelabs/](https://www.reddit.com/r/xencelabs/)

In online communities reddit you may notice that the vast majority of posts are complaints. Do not necessarily be concerned by this. It is true for any online community discussing any product. Most people only post when they have a problem. The completely satisfied users who don't have problems users rarely post about how good or seamless their experience has been.

However it is also true that online forums can be a great source to help you make choices about brands. For example, if you see a lot of questions/problems about a certain model, that should factor into your purchase decision.  &#x20;
