# Preface

## Introduction

Given my long time interest in drawing tablets I've always wanted to put together a history that would put together the various timelines, technologies, and products into a cohesive narrative.

Any such history is going to leave out many things and focus on some things to the exclusion of others.

But to the best of my ability I am working on putting one together now. I've just started this project in March of 2024. So at this stage what you're seeing is some initial notes. When I'm closer to being done I'll make that clear.

Until then if there's anything you'd like to see explored or any feedback you'd like to give please let me know at [thesevenpens@outlook.com](mailto:thesevenpens@outlook.com)
