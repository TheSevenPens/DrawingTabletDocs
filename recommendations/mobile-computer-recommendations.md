# Mobile computer recommendations

## Overview

Mobile computers that have pen support can play the role of a standalone drawing tablet. And [**I recommend them instead of pen computers**](../buying-a-drawing-tablet/the-case-against-pen-computers.md),&#x20;

## Examples

* Apple iPad
* Samsung Galaxy Tab S series
* Microsoft Surface Pro

## Apple iPads

[**iPads are excellent pen-computers / drawing tablets**](../buying-a-drawing-tablet/using-an-ipad-as-a-drawing-tablet.md).

* **Apple iPad Air (4th gen and later)** ($600)
* **Apple iPad Pro 11 inch (4th gen and later)** (starting at $800)
  * Supports Apple Pencil 2
* **Apple iPad pro 12.9 inch 6th gen** (starting at $1100)
  * Supports Apple Pencil 2

## Samsung Galaxy Tab S series

The Samsung Galaxy Tab S series of tablets and their S Pen will work well in the role of a drawing tablet.

[**My notes on Samsung Galaxy Tab devices**](../product-info/samsung/7p-notes-samsung-galaxy-tab.md). &#x20;

* [**Samsung Galaxy Tab S6 Lite (2022 version)**](../product-info/samsung/samsung-galaxy-tab-s6.md) ($240) is a good a low-cost option for beginners.&#x20;
* [**Samsung Galaxy Tab S9 FE** ](../product-info/samsung/samsung-galaxy-tab-s9.md)($500) excellent mid-budget option
* [**Samsung Galaxy Tab S9 Ultra** ](../product-info/samsung/samsung-galaxy-tab-s9.md)($1000) top-of-the-line performance.    &#x20;

## Microsoft Surface Pro

The **Surface Pro 8** (and above) is a good choice when combined with Surface Pro Signature Keyboard and Slim Pen 2.

* [**Surface Pro 8**](../product-info/microsoft/microsoft-surface-pro-8.md) (starting at $900)
* [**Surface Pro 9**](../product-info/microsoft/microsoft-surface-pro-9.md) (starting at $900)

Surface Pro 7 ands below do not have good pens for drawing. They exhibit too much line wobble.
