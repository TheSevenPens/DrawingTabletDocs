# Recommended drawing tablets for beginners

## Overview

I get so many people who are beginners asking for a drawing tablet. So, I decided to have a dedicated page to make it as simple as possible.

{% hint style="info" %}
I HIGHLY RECOMMEND you read [**Beginner's guide to drawing tablets**](../guides/beginners-guide.md).
{% endhint %}

If you want to see the full set recommendations go here: [**Drawing tablet recommendations**](./)&#x20;

Below you'll find my recommendations for: pen tablets (no screen), pen displays (have a screen), and standalone tablets.&#x20;

## Pen tablets

These are tablets WITHOUT a screen that need to be connected to a computer (some support wireless) to work.

If I had to pick one item on this list, I would recommend the Wacom CTL-672 for true beginners. It's reliable and has a decent drawing experience.

* One by Wacom Medium (CTL-672) \[no tilt, no wireless] ([<mark style="background-color:green;">**my notes**</mark>](../product-info/wacom/one-by-wacom/7p-notes-one-by-wacom-ctl-x72.md))
* Wacom Intuos Medium (CTL-6100) \[no tilt, no wireless]&#x20;
* Wacom Intuos Medium (CTL-6100WL) \[no tilt]
* XP-Pen Deco L (IT1060) \[no wireless]
* XP-Pen Deco LW (IT1060B)

## Pen displays

These are tablets WITH A SCREEN that need to be connected to a computer. No pen displays are wireless.

I honestly don't enjoy drawing an 13" display, I prefer 16" and above. But this size is a good way to get introduced to pen displays.

* Huion Kamvas 13 (GS1331)  ([<mark style="background-color:green;">**my notes**</mark>](../product-info/huion/huion-kamvas/7p-notes-huion-kamvas-13-gs1331.md))
* XP-Pen Artist 12 Gen2 (CD120FH)
* XP-Pen Artist 13 GEN2 (CD130FH)  ([<mark style="background-color:green;">**my notes**</mark>](../product-info/xp-pen/xp-pen-artist-gen2/7p-notes-xp-pen-artist-16-gen2-cd160fh.md))

## Standalone tablets

These are tablets that don't need to be connect to a computer.

* Any Apple iPad that works with the Apple Pencil 2 ([<mark style="background-color:green;">**My notes on using Apple iPads**</mark>](../product-info/apple/7p-notes-apple-ipad.md))
* Samsung Galaxy Tab S9 FE ([<mark style="background-color:green;">**My notes on Samsung Galaxy Tab devices**</mark>](../product-info/samsung/7p-notes-samsung-galaxy-tab-s.md)  )
* Samsung Galaxy Tab S6 lite (2022 edition)  ([<mark style="background-color:green;">**My notes on Samsung Galaxy Tab devices**</mark>](../product-info/samsung/7p-notes-samsung-galaxy-tab-s.md)  ) - a little bit sluggish but the price is great.
