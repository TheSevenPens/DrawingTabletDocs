{% endhint %}

A standalone drawing tablet might be exactly what you need if you intend to be using the device often in scenarios away from home or away from your desk.

People look for standalone tablets for these kinds of reasons:

* Can travel with it
* Can be used on the couch in the bed on a bus etc.
* Doesn't require the connection to a computer

There are many options depending on what you really need.

## Kinds of standalone drawing tablets

There are three kinds of standalone drawing tablets:

* **Mobile computers with pen support** - Formally, these are not drawing tablets, but they can work just like one. And often I think they are your best choice for a standalone tablet. These include products such as Apple iPad Pros and Samsung Galaxy S series tablets.
  * Operating system: a mobile OS (iOS, ChromeOS)
  * Scenario: General purpose
  * Pen tech: varies. Apple Pencil, AES, EMR&#x20;
* **Pen computers** - The are true drawing tablets that you can carry around and use without a computer.  [**I don't recommend pen computers**](../buying-a-drawing-tablet/the-case-against-pen-computers.md)**.**
  * Operating system: currently all run Windows
  * Scenario: Intended for artists
  * Pen tech: EMR
* **2-in-1 laptops and slate laptops** - Formally, these are not drawing tablets. These are really normal laptops  that have a form factor that might also serve the needs of a drawing tablet. Examples: Microsoft Surface Pro and Samsung Galaxy Book4 360.
  * Operating system: currently all run Windows
  * Scenario: General purpose
  * Pen tech: varies. MPP, EMR

## Pen computers

Even though as a policy, I do NOT recommend them, for completeness here is a list of SOME pen computers. More here:  [**I don't recommend pen computers**](../buying-a-drawing-tablet/the-case-against-pen-computers.md)**.**

**Examples:**

## **2-in-1 laptops and slate laptop**

These kinds of devices are really for general purpose use. So if what you want is a full operating system where you can use things like Microsoft Office, or the full version of Photoshop, etcetera. Then these suitable choices for a standalone tablet.
