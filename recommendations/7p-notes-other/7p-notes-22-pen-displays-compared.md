# 7P notes: 22" pen displays compared

## Overview

&#x20;As of June 2024, there are three 22" pen displays to consider buying. All three are acceptable choices depending on your budget.

* Wacom Cintiq Pro 22 (DTH-227)
* XP-Pen Artist 22 Plus (MD220FH)
* Huion Kamvas 22 Plus (GS2202) - [<mark style="background-color:green;">**my notes on this tablet**</mark>](../../product-info/huion/huion-kamvas/7p-notes-huion-gs2202.md) &#x20;

## Ranking

Note: I personally own all three of these tablets

* \#1 Wacom Cintiq Pro 22 (DTH-227)
* \#2 XP-Pen Artist 22 Plus (MD220FH)
* \#3 Huion Kamvas 22 Plus (GS2202)

The Cintiq Pro 22  (DTH-227) is the clear winner on almost every level. However it is expensive.&#x20;

If the Cintiq Pro 22 is out of your price range I would pick the Artist 22 Plus over the Kamvas 22 Plus. but to it having a better pen than the Huion and simpler cabling.

| Huion Kamvas 22 Plus (GS2202)   | Huion PW517     |                                                                                                                                              |

The Pro Pen 3 is clearly the superior pen.

The X3 Pro pen is a big improvement from previous generations of XP-Pen pens. The X3 Pro pen is also better than the Huion PW517 pen.
