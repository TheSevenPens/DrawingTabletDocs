# 7P notes: 22" pen displays compared

## Overview

&#x20;As of June 2024, there are three 22" pen displays to consider buying. All three are acceptable choices depending on your budget.

* Wacom Cintiq Pro 22 (DTH-227)
  * If you want the same Wacom drawing quality but are willing to use an older device consider the Wacom Cintiq 22 (DTK-2260). [<mark style="background-color:green;">**My notes on this tablet**</mark>](../../product-info/wacom/wacom-cintiq/7p-notes-wacom-dtk-2260.md)
* XP-Pen Artist 22 Plus (MD220FH)
* Huion Kamvas 22 Plus (GS2202) - [<mark style="background-color:green;">**my notes on this tablet**</mark>](../../product-info/huion/huion-kamvas/7p-notes-huion-gs2202.md) &#x20;

## Ranking

Note: I personally own all three of these tablets

* \#1 Wacom Cintiq Pro 22 (DTH-227)
* \#2 XP-Pen Artist 22 Plus (MD220FH)
* \#3 Huion Kamvas 22 Plus (GS2202)

The Cintiq Pro 22  (DTH-227) is the clear winner on almost every level. However it is expensive.&#x20;

If the Cintiq Pro 22 is out of your price range I would pick the Artist 22 Plus over the Kamvas 22 Plus. but to it having a better pen than the Huion and simpler cabling.

* The Pro Pen 3 is clearly the superior pen.
* The X3 Pro pen is a big improvement from previous generations of XP-Pen pens. The X3 Pro pen is also better than the Huion PW517 pen.
* X3  Pro - has wider maximum pressure than the PW517
* X3 Pro - has eraser, PW517 does not

## Noise

The Cintiq Pro 22 has a fan that is constantly on. It's not loud but it is audible and could be an irritation for some people.

The Artist 22 Plus and Kamvas 22 Plus are completely silent.

## Diagonal wobble

* All three are EXCELLENT with almost no diagonal wobble
