# 7P notes: 22" pen displays compared

## Overview

&#x20;As of June 2024, there are three 22" pen displays to consider buying

* Wacom Cintiq Pro 22 (DTH-227)
* XP-Pen Artist 22 Plus (MD220FH)
* Huion Kamvas 22 Plus (GS2202)

## Ranking

Note: I personally own all three of these tablets

* \#1 Wacom Cintiq Pro 22 (DTH-227)
* \#2 XP-Pen Artist 22 Plus (MD220FH)
* \#3 Huion Kamvas 22 Plus (GS2202)

The Cintiq Pro 22  (DTH-227) is the clear winner on almost every level. However it is expensive.&#x20;

If the Cintiq Pro 22 is out of your price range I would pick the Artist 22 Plus over the Kamvas 22 Plus. but to it having a better pen than the Huion and simpler cabling.

## Pens

| Tablet                          | Pen in the box  |
| ------------------------------- | --------------- |
| Wacom Cintiq Pro 22 (DTH-227)   | Wacom Pro Pen 3 |
| XP-Pen Artist 22 Plus (MD220FH) | XP-Pen X3 Pro   |
| Huion Kamvas 22 Plus (GS2202)   | Huion PW517     |

The Pro Pen 3 is clearly the superior pen.

The X3 Pro pen is a big improvement from previous generations of XP-Pen pens.
