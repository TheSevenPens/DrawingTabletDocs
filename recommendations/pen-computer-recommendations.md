# Standalone drawing tablet recommendations

## Overview

Read this first: [**Buying a drawing tablet**](../buying-a-drawing-tablet/). There are two kinds of standalone drawing tablets:

* **pen computers** - drawing tablets that you can carry around and use without a computer.  [**I don't recommend pen computers**](../buying-a-drawing-tablet/the-case-against-pen-computers.md)
* **mobile computers with pen support** - These are not drawing but they can work just like one and your best choice for a standalone tablet. These include products such as Apple iPad Pros, Samsung Galaxy S series tablets, and the Microsoft Surface Pro.

## Mobile computers with pen support

### Apple iPads

[**iPads are excellent pen-computers / drawing tablets**](../buying-a-drawing-tablet/using-an-ipad-as-a-drawing-tablet.md).

* **Apple iPad Air (4th gen and later)** ($600)
* **Apple iPad Pro 11 inch (4th gen and later)** (starting at $800)
  * Supports Apple Pencil 2
* **Apple iPad pro 12.9 inch 6th gen** (starting at $1100)
  * Supports Apple Pencil 2

### Samsung Galaxy Tab S series

The Samsung Galaxy Tab S series of tablets and their S Pen will work well in the role of a drawing tablet.

[**My notes on Samsung Galaxy Tab devices**](../product-info/samsung/7p-notes-samsung-galaxy-tab.md). &#x20;

* [**Samsung Galaxy Tab S6 Lite (2022 version)**](../product-info/samsung/samsung-galaxy-tab-s6.md) ($240) is a good a low-cost option for beginners.&#x20;
* [**Samsung Galaxy Tab S9 FE** ](../product-info/samsung/samsung-galaxy-tab-s9.md)($500) excellent mid-budget option
* [**Samsung Galaxy Tab S9 Ultra** ](../product-info/samsung/samsung-galaxy-tab-s9.md)($1000) top-of-the-line performance.    &#x20;

### Microsoft Surface Pro

The **Surface Pro 8** (and above) is a good choice when combined with Surface Pro Signature Keyboard and Slim Pen 2.

* [**Surface Pro 8**](../product-info/microsoft/microsoft-surface-pro-8.md) (starting at $900)
* [**Surface Pro 9**](../product-info/microsoft/microsoft-surface-pro-9.md) (starting at $900)

Surface Pro 7 ands below do not have good pens for drawing. They exhibit too much line wobble.



## Pen computers

Even though as a policy, I do NOT recommend them, for completeness here is a list of SOME pen computers.



### **Mid budget**&#x20;

* **Huion Kamvas Studio 16** ($1700)

### **High budget**

* **Wacom MobileStudio Pro 13** ($2500)
* **Huion Kamvas Studio 24** ($2400)

### **Super-high budget**
