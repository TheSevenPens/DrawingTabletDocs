# Powering a drawing tablet

## Power requirements

* **Pen tablets** require minimal amounts of power. They get enough power from a normal USB 2.0 port.
* **Pen displays** require much more power than a pen tablet due to the embedded display panel. They may have a power adapter that you need to plug into the wall. Or they may be able to be powered with through a USB-C cable.

## Batteries

* **Pen tablets** that have wireless support have built-in batteries that can usually last the entire day and do recharge quickly when they are plugged back in.
* **Pen displays** DO NOT have batteries. They must get their power from a cable that is either attached to a computer or to power coming from a wall.
