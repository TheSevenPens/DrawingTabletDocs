# Erasing

## Overview

Besides drawing, pens have varying support for specifically erasing things. Typically this is done either with an eraser on the pen or using the pen buttons to perform the erasing.

## Erasers

Below you can see the nib and the eraser for the Wacom Pro Pen 2 (KP-504E). As you can see the nib is quite a bit larger than the nib.

The eraser is also pressure sensitive and retracts into the pen. The eraser has a much bigger retraction distance than the nib.

### Pens that have erasers

Erasers are relatively uncommon for EMR pens.

### App support for erasers

Drawing apps have to add deliberate support for erasers. Some do have support. Some do not.

## Usage of erasers

Lots of people do use the eraser and find it critical, but then lots of people never use the eraser. I'm one of the "never use" category.

For me flipping the pen around to use the eraser feels like it disrupts my flow and sometimes I simply am too clumsy and I have dropped the pen while I was rotating it. Also I just think it is faster to use a keyboard shortcut or to use my tourbox device.

### Pen compatibility with tablets

{% hint style="info" %}
Remember that a specific tablet is compatible with only specific pens. Avoid buying a pen that has an eraser and assuming it will work with your tablet. Always check with the manufacturer.
{% endhint %}

## Using the side buttons to erase

Another option is to map the side buttons to switch to the eraser tool in the app you are using. You can do this in the tablet driver app.
