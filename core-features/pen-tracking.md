# Pen tracking

## Introduction

* **Pen tracking is** the tablet's interpretation of the physical position of pen. &#x20;

## Overview

* **Pen tracking accuracy** = excluding parallax and lag, this is how close the the operating system cursor (mouse pointer) is to the physical tip of the pen.
* Perfectly accurate pen tracking means the tablet things the pen is exactly where the physical tip is. Any deviation from that is an inaccuracy.
* All tablets are slightly inaccurate. Naturally it is much more obvious when a pen display is inaccurate.
*   #### Pen tracking calibration

    If your pen's position is not matching where the pointer is, [**pen tracking calibration**](../guides/customizing-your-experience/calibrate-pen-position-on-a-pen-display.md) may help.

## Corner accuracy in pen displays

The pointer is generally a bit more offset from the tip of the pen toward the edges and especially the corners rather then the main part of the screen.

This offset in the edges and corners is totally normal. Some tablets have more and some have less.

Tablet manufacturers (except for Wacom) often publish their official corner accuracy numbers. Here are some typical values I've seen.

* ±3mm
* ±1.5mm
* ±1mm

If you have a pen display and it seems to exceed what the manufacturer says it has and you are disturbed by it, you should contact support. &#x20;

For myself, generally even if I see ±3mm it isn't really a problem because I am not drawing in those areas. But of course, it does look weird and I would like it always to be more accurate and do prefer ±1mm.
