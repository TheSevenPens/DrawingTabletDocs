# Pen nib material

## Overview

The nibs of drawing tablet pens can be made of different materials. The most common nib material is plastic or felt. The vast majority of pens, by default, have a plastic nib pre-installed.&#x20;

The reason for different materials is that they greatly impact the sensation of "texture" you experience.

## Subjective impact on texture

* Plastic nibs generally feel smoother when drawing on a given surface. Some of the surface texture will get transmitted through the plastic nib.
* Felt nibs provide a little more friction and many people say it can make a tablet surface feel more like traditional paper.&#x20;
* I always suggest giving felt nibs a try, you may enjoy how it feels.

## Wear and tear

Both kinds of nibs wear over time and the amount of wear depends on how "heavy-handed" you are. But these materials are a little different.

* Plastic nibs wear down less.
* Felt nibs are more prone to wearing down.  Also if you drop your pen and it hits the nib, sometimes I have found that the felt nib can be more easily damaged.

## Example: Wacom One GEN2 pen (CP-923) nib material&#x20;

Wacom offers three materials for this pen (standard, elastomer, felt). See this video for an explanation of how standard, elastomer, and felt feel: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=APAO-yWc\_PY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=APAO-yWc\_PY) &#x20;

## Metal nibs

I DO NOT recommend [**using a metal nib**](../guides/customizing-your-experience/using-metal-nibs.md).
