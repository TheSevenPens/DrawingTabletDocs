# ExpressKeys

## Overview&#x20;

**ExpresKeys** is a Wacom-specific term, but people use it in general additional inputs for any tablet. Drawing tablets often have additional "inputs" such as:

* Buttons (both physical and capacitive)
* Dials
* Touch-sensitive strips

## Other names

Huion calls these buttons "Press Keys"

## Disabling Express Keys

Some people love using these kind of inputs, but some people do not like them because either they

* take up space on the tablet
* are accidentally triggered
* or their workflow just doesn't benefit from them

For these cases, you should be aware that these inputs can often be configured in the tablet driver to "do nothing".

## Actions&#x20;

You can map the buttons to take a variety of actions. Broadly the categories are

* Mouse-related actions - right click, left-click, double click
* System navigation - scroll left, scroll right, zoom in/out, pan, switch applications
* System tasks - run application, open a file
* Keyboard - Press a key, hold down a modifier key

## Global vs application configuration

Tablet drivers also let you configure how these buttons work depending on the app you are using.

For example you can set a button to

* Increase brush size when you are using Photoshop
* Increase opacity when you are using Clip Studio Paint
* Increase the volume of your speakers under all other conditions

## Common useful assignments

### Buttons

* Undo | Redo
* Zoom In | Out | to 100% | Zoom to Fit
* Increase | Decrease brush size
* Increase | Decrease burhs opacity
* Rotate Left | Right | Reset to 0 degrees
* Switch between tools (brush, eyedropper, etc.)
* Select All | None | Invert | Lasso selection | color similarity selection
* Go to layer above | below

### Rotary dials

These are great for "paired" tasks

* Zoom In / Out
* Increase / Decrease brush size
* Increase / Decrease brush opacity
* Rotate canvas

Some rotary dials support turning as well as a third press action. This is useful for a situations where there are three related actions such as rotate right, ritate left, and reset rotation.
