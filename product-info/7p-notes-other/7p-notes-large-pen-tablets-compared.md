# 7P notes: Large pen tablets compared

## Overview

Large pen tablets have an active area diagonal size of about 15".&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
Even if a tablet has "large" in its name, it doesn't mean it us truly a large tablet. A perfect example is the Huion Inspiroy 2 Large which is more of a medium sized tablet. Same with the XP-Pen Deco L/LW.
{% endhint %}

## Key considerations

Using a large tablet is very different from using a medium size tablet. There are many things you have to adjust to. More here: Using large pen tablets&#x20;

## Ranking

In terms of drawing performance the best of the three is the Intuos Pro Large (PTH-860).

Second is the XP-Pen Deco Pro XLW (MT1592B). The things to note about this tablet is the excellent design and vastly improved pressure handling coming from its X3 Pro pen.

Third, the Huion Giano overall is very good. It's a very close third to the XP Pen Deco Pro XLW because the PW517 pen does not handle pressure (smaller pressure range for example) as well as the X3 Pro pen.&#x20;

## Considerations

**Tablet age** - don't let the fact that the Intuos Pro Large was released in 2017 dissuade you. It's still better than the most recent tablets put out by the competition

**Pen replacement cos**t - Keep in mind the Pro Pen 2 is very expensive ay $80. It's a significant cost if you need to replace it. The  PW517 is $50 and the X3 Pro is $40.
