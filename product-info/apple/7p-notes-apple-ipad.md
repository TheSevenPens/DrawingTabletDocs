# 7P notes: Apple iPad

## Overview

iPads - specifically those that use the Apple Pencil 2 - are very compelling alternative to a typical EMR standalone drawing tablet. They are lightweight, mobile, have a great display, a rich app ecosystem, and the drawing experience, while different is very similar to that of a drawing tablet.

## Terminology

Apple calls their pen the **Apple Pencil**. I often just call it a **pen** to keep consistent with rest of my documentation.

## iPad benefits

### Basics

* The display is fantastic - great color and bright for a pen display
* Does not require a computer to be attached

### Mobility

* All iPad models use WiFi.&#x20;
* Some models can also use a mobile data plan like a phone.&#x20;
* It has great battery life

### Drawing

* The Apple pencil is very responsive and supports pressure and tilt
* iPad apps are optimized to make the most of the screen real estate available and to be responsive to touch. &#x20;
* Newer Apple iPad Pro models use the Apple Pencil 2 - which support pen hover
* Very little pointer lag. Apple iPads have much less lag than pen displays or pen computers. The pointer is comparable to a pen tablet.

## &#x20;iPad challenges

### Apps

* Not all PC applications are available on iPad.&#x20;
* Applications on iPad may not be as full-featured as their PC equivalents.
* Some popular drawing apps like Clip Studio Paint are available on iOS, MacOS, Windows.&#x20;
* The most popular drawing app on the iPad, ProCreate, does not have a version for MacOS or Windows. This may be an issue for you if you want to use the same app on your desktop as well as on your iPad.&#x20;

### Drawing

* Slippery glass surface when using the Apple Pencil. This can be mitigating by purchasing a screen protector which provides a more textured surface.
* Noticeable diagonal wobble when drawing slowly. But this doesn't seem to hinder people.

### Apple Pencil

* Apple Pencil does not have buttons like a normal drawing tablet pen
* Apple Pencil does not have an eraser unlike some EMR pens.
* Older iPad Pro models models do not support pen hover regardless of which Apple Pencil us used.
* Not all iPads support the use of the Apple Pencil. See: [https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT211029](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT211029)

## Surface texture

* When using the Apple Pencil with the iPad, most people will find that touching the glass feels "slippery".&#x20;
* Some people a do not like this slipperiness and purchase a protective sheet to put over top of it that provides texture for the pen.
* For protective sheets for iPads there are some options here: [**Protective sheets**](../../accessories/protective-sheets/)&#x20;

## Pencil support

* Since around 2015, iPads have supported an Apple pencil. So ensure that the iPad you are purchasing supports the use of a pencil
* List of iPad Models that support the Apple pencil: [https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT211029](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT211029)

## Pencil versions

* There are two models of pencil: Apple Pencil, and Apple Pencil 2
* Apple Pencil 2 is superior
* So, it is better to get a model that supports the Apple Pencil 2

## Pen hover

Pen hover is the ability of a tablet to detect and show the position of the pen without the pen touching the screen. Some people - especially artists - really depend on this feature. For others it is not so important. Read this doc to learn more about it and why it could be important for you: [**Pen hover**](../../guides/core-features/pen-hover.md)&#x20;

Hover support in iPads:

* iPad Pro models that use the M2 chip with Apple Pencil 2 do support pen hover &#x20;
* Other models of iPads do NOT support pen hover.

## **Parallax**&#x20;

iPads that support the Apple Pencil have EXCELLENT parallax compared to even the best pen displays. More here: [Parallax](../../guides/pen-displays/parallax.md)&#x20;

## Pointer lag

* iPads have incredibly little pointer lag. &#x20;
* Pen displays have much more pointer lag than an iPad.&#x20;
* More here: [lag](../../guides/core-features/lag.md)&#x20;

## **Anti-glare sparkle**

* You may or may not be sensitive to this effect. Some people hate it. Some are much less sensitive to it.&#x20;
* iPads don't show much AG sparkle at all - I would say it is undetectable in the iPads I have examined
* Pen displays have AG sparkle to various degrees. More here: [anti-glare sparkle](7p-notes-apple-ipad.md#anti-glare-sparkle)

## **Size**

I prefer to draw on larger devices (16" and above - and strongly prefer 22" to 24") when I am at my desk. That is an advantage of pen displays because they vary in size from 12" to 30".

But for mobile use, the size of the iPad (11" & 12.9") is much more convenient than any pen display.

## Accessories

* [iPad stands](../../accessories/stands/ipad-stands.md)

## iPad apps for creative work

* [Clip Studio Paint](../../applications/clip-studio-paint.md) (My favorite for illustration!)&#x20;
* [Procreate](../../applications/procreate.md) (#1 iPad app for drawing)
* [Concepts](7p-notes-apple-ipad.md#concepts) &#x20;
* [Infinite Painter](7p-notes-apple-ipad.md#infinite-painter)  &#x20;
* [Medibang](../../applications/medibang.md)  &#x20;
* [Paint Tool Sai](../../applications/painttool-sai.md) &#x20;
* [ArtRage](7p-notes-apple-ipad.md#artrage)  &#x20;

## How I use iPads

I use iPads for drawing - but mostly when I am at not my desk or when I am mobile. Otherwise when sitting at my desk I prefer to use a pen tablet or pen display.&#x20;

I use these iPad models with an Apple Pencil 2:

* Apple iPad Pro (12.9 inch) (3rd gen) - Does NOT support hover
* Apple iPad Pro (11 inch) (4rd gen) - Does support hover.

I primarily these use iPad apps&#x20;

* [Procreate](../../applications/procreate.md)
* [Clip Studio Paint](../../applications/clip-studio-paint.md) &#x20;

I occasionally use these iPad apps

* [Concepts](../../applications/concepts-app.md)  &#x20;

## Transferring files between iPads and Windows

One easy way to send files easily back and forth between an iPad and Windows is to use a file syncing service. For example OneDrive - which is what I use.

I put my Clip Studio Paint files in a OneDrive folder and sync them to multiple PCs and my iPad. This allows me to edit them with whatever device I want. And changes are automatically synced to all the devices. &#x20;
