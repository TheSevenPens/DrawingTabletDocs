# 7P notes: XP-Pen Artist 13 GEN2 (CD130FH)

## Overall

Decent tablet. Not the ultimate drawing experience but I think it will server a lot of people well and is a good beginner tablet.

## Basics

* Model year: 2022
* Product page: [https://www.xp-pen.com/ie-store/buy/artist-13-2nd-generation.html](https://www.xp-pen.com/ie-store/buy/artist-13-2nd-generation.html)&#x20;

## Pen

Comes with the XP-Pen X3 Elite pen - with an OK IAF and a GOOD pressure range. More here: [<mark style="background-color:green;">**My notes on the X3 elite pen**</mark>](../xp-pen-pens/7p-notes-xp-pen-x3-elite-pen.md)

### Pen tracking <a href="#center-versus-corner-accuracy" id="center-versus-corner-accuracy"></a>

* Accuracy in edges and corners is good.
* XP-pen lists accuracy as:
  * center ±0.5mm
  * corner ± 2mm
* I agree with XP-Pens accuracy numbers

## Diagonal wobble

EXCELLENT. very little wobble. at all stroke speeds.

These are 10cm lines - each drawn over 4 seconds. V

### Anti-glare sparkle <a href="#anti-glare-sparkle" id="anti-glare-sparkle"></a>

Amount of AG sparkle is at the LOW end of MODERATE

I didn't find the sparkle distracting. And I don't notice it at my normal eye distance when drawing.

It has more sparkle than the Wacom One (DTC-133) but less than the Huion Kamvas 13.

## Drawing Experience <a href="#drawing-experience" id="drawing-experience"></a>

These things worked well

* drawing lots of dots
* drawing many small quick tiny low pressure lines - hatching&#x20;
* keeping pressure constant
* moving between high and low pressure smoothly
* Line Tapering - typical&#x20;

## Pen pressure range <a href="#pressure-range" id="pressure-range"></a>

See: [<mark style="background-color:green;">**My notes on the X3 elite pen**</mark>](../xp-pen-pens/7p-notes-xp-pen-x3-elite-pen.md)

## Pointer lag <a href="#pointer-lag" id="pointer-lag"></a>

TYPICAL for a pen display - very slightly more than typical. But not by much.

## Parallax

VERY GOOD. The tip of the pointer aligns very closely with the tip of the pen.

## Ports

2 USB-C ports on the side

Note that the ports are deeply recessed into wells.

## Cables and connections

Comes with a a 3-in-1 cable. Which I didn't use.

Instead I my own Thunderbolt 3 cable.&#x20;

because the USB-C ports are in deep wells, my TB3 cable has ends that are too thick to fit in the well. I had to chop away some plastic to make it fit.

## Using a single-USB-C cable

This works. I was able to use it with a single USB-C cable
