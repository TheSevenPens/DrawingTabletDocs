# 7P notes: XP-Pen Artist 12 Gen2 (CD120FH)

## Summary

I have this tablet but haven't used it extensively. Overall seemed like a decent tablet.&#x20;

* The X3 Elite pen it came with had a good physical pressure range.
* The display has low amounts of anti-glare sparkle.
* The tablet exhibited a little more diagonal wobble than I normally like but smoothing/stabilization should help. The Artist 13 GEN2 unit has less diagonal wobble.

## Basics

* Model year: 2022



## Pen

Comes with the XP-Pen X3 Elite pen - with an OK IAF and a GOOD pressure range. More here: [<mark style="background-color:green;">**My notes on the X3 elite pen**</mark>](../xp-pen-pens/7p-notes-xp-pen-x3-elite-pen.md)

## Pen tracking <a href="#center-versus-corner-accuracy" id="center-versus-corner-accuracy"></a>

* XP-pen lists accuracy as:
  * center ±0.5mm
  * corner ± 2mm
* I agree with XP-Pens accuracy numbers

## Diagonal wobble

## Pointer lag <a href="#pointer-lag" id="pointer-lag"></a>

TYPICAL for a pen display - very slightly more than typical. But not by much.

## Parallax

VERY GOOD. The tip of the pointer aligns very closely with the tip of the pen.
