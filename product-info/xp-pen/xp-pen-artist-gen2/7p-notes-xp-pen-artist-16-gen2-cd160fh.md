# 7P notes: XP-Pen Artist 16 GEN2 (CD160FH)

<mark style="color:red;">**My notes: I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS TABLET**</mark>

* This pen display exhibits more diagonal wobble than is acceptable.
* Brad Colbow demonstrates the wobble at 7:04 in this video: [https://youtu.be/4czV7jv9mPg](https://youtu.be/4czV7jv9mPg).&#x20;
  * Brad shows the wobble occurring even when he is moving the pen fast - which is unusual for diagonal wobble. Diagonal wobble is usually something that happens only when the pen is moving slow.
* I will reconsider this anti-recommendation if I see evidence that a driver or firmware update substantially reduces the diagonal wobble.
