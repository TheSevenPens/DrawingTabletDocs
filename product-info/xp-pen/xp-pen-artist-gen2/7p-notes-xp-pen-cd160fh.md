# 7P notes: XP-Pen Artist 16 GEN2 (CD160FH)

<mark style="color:red;">**I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS TABLET DUE TO EXCESSIVE DIAGONAL WOBBLE**</mark>&#x20;

* Learn more here: [**diagonal wobble**](../../../core-features/diagonal-wobble.md)&#x20;
* This pen display exhibits more diagonal wobble than is acceptable.
* A little bit of wobble common to drawing tablets and is acceptable and can be adjusted for
* However, this tablet exhibits excessive wobble and exhibits it with fast strokes. This is unacceptable.
* Brad Colbow demonstrates the wobble with fast strokes here at 7:04 in this video: [https://youtu.be/4czV7jv9mPg](https://youtu.be/4czV7jv9mPg).&#x20;
* I will reconsider recommending this tablet, if I see evidence that a driver or firmware update substantially reduces the diagonal wobble.
