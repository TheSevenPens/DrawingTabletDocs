## Anti-glare sparkle

RATING: VERY GOOD. Low amounts of AG sparkle. Maybe just slightly more than the Cintiq Pro 22.

## Sharpness

Pixels are relatively clear and well delineated.

The look is clearly sharper than the Huion Kamvas Pro 19 which has a soft look that some people don't like

## Design

* Really does look like a larger version of the XP-Pen Artist Pro 16 GEN2&#x20;

## Pens

* X3 Pro Roller Stylus
* X3 Pro Slim Stylus

## Compatible pens

* X3 Pro Roller Stylus
* X3 Pro Slim Stylus
* X3 Pro - I tested this. It worked.

## Pen pressure

XP-Pen states for X3 Pro pens

* IAF: 3gf
* Max Pressure: 400gf

## Accuracy

XP-Pen states:

* Center:  ±0.4 mm&#x20;
* Corner: ±0.8 mm&#x20;

RATING: VERY GOOD.

My experience matched the accuracy numbers XP-Pen provides.

## Tilt compensation

RATING: GOOD

* At 45 degrees: Minor deflection of pointer - maybe 1mm&#x20;
* At 60 degrees: Minor deflection of pointer - maybe 1mm

## Pressure scan rate testing

RATING: VERY GOOD

Drawing 50 strokes as fast possible results in no lost strokes.

## Connections and cabling

### Ports

* 2 USB-C ports on the top edge
  * The ports are NOT recessed

### How I connected it

* SETUP 1
  * M3 MacBook Pro with provided USB-C cable
  * This setup DID not work&#x20;
    * The MacBook USB-C port did provide enough power for the display
    * However, the driver could not detect the tablet - even though the pen would move the OS pointer
    * I tested the same cable and macbook with with the XP-Pen Artist Pro 16 GEN2. And that worked.
* SETUP 2
  * MinisForum HX99G with provided USB-C cable attached to the HX99G USB4 port
  * The MinisForum could not provide enough power (the display would power up for a moment then go black for  few seconds, and then repeat this process endlessly)
  * I used an additional Thunderbolt 3 cable plugged into a hub to provide additional power.
  * Once I had the additional power everything worked correctly&#x20;

## VESA

Yes this tablet is VESA mountable (75mm x 75mm)

## Legs

## Stand

I used the stand that came with the Xencelabs Pen Display 16 to hold this tablet. It worked very well.
