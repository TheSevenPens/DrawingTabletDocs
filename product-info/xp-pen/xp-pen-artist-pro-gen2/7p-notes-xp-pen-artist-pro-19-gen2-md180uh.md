## Surface texture

As is typical for etched glass surfaces, there is a slight surface texture.

Using the same X3 Pro pen with a plastic nib&#x20;

The XP-Pen Artist Pro 19 GEN2 has an amount of surface texture that is

* about the same as the XP-Pen Artist Pro 19 GEN2&#x20;
* about the same as the Huion Kamvas Pro 19
* a little less than the XP-Pen Artist 22 Plus
* a little less than the Cintiq Pro 22

## Connections and cabling

### Ports

* 2 USB-C ports on the top edge
  * The ports are NOT recessed

### How I connected it

* SETUP 1
  * M3 MacBook Pro with provided USB-C cable
  * This setup DID not work&#x20;
    * The MacBook USB-C port did provide enough power for the display
    * However, the driver could not detect the tablet - even though the pen would move the OS pointer
    * I tested the same cable and macbook with with the XP-Pen Artist Pro 16 GEN2. And that worked.
* SETUP 2
  * MinisForum HX99G with provided USB-C cable attached to the HX99G USB4 port
  * The MinisForum could not provide enough power (the display would power up for a moment then go black for  few seconds, and then repeat this process endlessly)
  * I used an additional Thunderbolt 3 cable plugged into a hub to provide additional power.
  * Once I had the additional power everything worked correctly&#x20;
