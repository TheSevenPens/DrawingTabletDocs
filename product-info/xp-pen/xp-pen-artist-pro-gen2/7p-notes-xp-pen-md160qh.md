# 7P notes: XP-Pen Artist Pro 16 GEN2 (MD160QH)

## **Overall**

In summary this is a very nice tablet. Wacom Cintiq Pro models are still better (and cost MUCH more) but this tablet is good overall and I have enjoyed using it. As of July 2024, this is my top pick for a mid-range-cost 16" pen display. &#x20;

## **Design**

RATING: EXCELLENT

* I like the overall design. Looks and feels very premium.&#x20;
* XP-Pen logo on bottom of tablet. It's present and visible without being obtrusive.

## **Pen**&#x20;

The tablet comes with the the new **XP-Pen X3 Pro Pen**. It is incredibly similar in shape to the Wacom Pro Pen 2. The pen handles pressure very well and has an eraser. Many more details here: [**XP-Pen X3 Pro pen**](../xp-pen-pens/7p-notes-xp-pen-x3-pro-pen.md)

## **Display**&#x20;

**Native resolution** - 2560x1600. This is big improvement over an HD (1920x1080) screen at this size.

**Refresh rate** - 60Hz. TYPICAL. Normal for pen displays.

**Anti-glare sparkle -** GOOD. Low amount of AG sparkle. More here: [**Anti-glare sparkle**](../../../guides/pen-displays/anti-glare-sparkle.md).

**Sharpness** - GOOD. The AG treatment does not add any blurriness.&#x20;

**Parallax** - GOOD. Little visible parallax.

**Aspect Ratio** - 16:10. It is a little more squarish than the much more common 16:9 aspect ratio. After using it for a few days, I actually like the 16:10 aspect ratio. To me it makes the tablet feel a little larger than it is.&#x20;

## **Connections and cabling**

**Single USB-C cable connection?**

YES. I tried the cable that it came with and a Thunderbolt 3 cable. It worked in both cases. More here: [Connecting a pen display with one USB-C cable](../../../guides/connections-and-cabling/connecting-a-pen-display-with-one-usb-c-cable.md)

**Ports**

There are two USB-C ports on the top edge of the tablet. Both ports are recessed into wells.

If you intend to use a 3rd-party USB-C cable, be aware they may not fit into the well.

One minor nit. The USB-C cable connects at the top edge this means you see the cable connect. This is normal for pen displays these days. But it does make the device a little less elegant.

**3-in-1 cable**

This is NOT provided in the box. If you need to connect via HDMI you will have to order this separately from XP-Pen.

## **Basics**

**Pointer lag -** TYPICAL. Slightly better than normal for a pen display.

**Line steadiness -** OK. The line have a little bit of unsteadiness when moving slow. I can mitigate that in Clip Studio paint by turning on the **Stabilization > Adjust by Speed** option and setting it to stabilize when drawing slowly.&#x20;

**Corner accuracy** VERY GOOD. Compared to other tablets has very minor inaccuracy at edges and corners.

**Tilt compensation** - GOOD. Pointer stays close to physical tip of the pen as pen moves through supported tilt range.

## **Diagonal wobble**

RATING: OK. very slightly increase in wobble is slow strokes. Totally acceptable. A little brush smoothing eliminates it..

## Legs

YES - It has two foldable legs on the back allow it to be propped up at an angle. However, I just use a spare HUION stand for a better angle.

## Express Keys

NONE.&#x20;

## VESA mounting

This tablet does support the VESA mounting standard. I have used it with several VESA compatible stands.&#x20;

## Shape

* Thicker toward the top
* Thinner toward the bottom
* The bottom edge rolls off a bit making it a bit nicer for you hand or arm to rest on that edge.

## Audio features

None. No speakers. No headphone jack.

## Touch

This tablet does NOT support touch.

## Heat

Felt cool (room temperature) to the touch at 50% brightness.

## Noise

Completely silent.

## Fans

The tablet has no fans.

## Remote&#x20;

The tablet comes with a remote with programmable keys.

## Tilt compensation

Tilting the pen within the supported tilt range did not significantly alter the pointer position. It remained close to the tip. I tried this with 3 different X3 Pro pens and got the same result.

In one of the photos you may notice a slight separation between pointer and tip, I think this is mostly due to the position calibration of the pen and not so much the tilt.&#x20;

I have heard a few comments on my YouTube channel indicating that some people found very bad tilt compensation. So far I believe if there is an issue it is only with a small number of defective units.&#x20;
