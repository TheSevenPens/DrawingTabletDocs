# 7P notes: XP-Pen Artist Pro 16 GEN2 (MD160QH)

## **Overall**

In summary this is a very nice tablet. Wacom Cintiq Pro models are still better (and cost MUCH more) but this tablet is good overall.&#x20;

## **Design**

I like the overall design. Looks and feels very premium.

One minor nit. The USB-C cable connects at the top edge this means you see the cable connect. This is normal for pen displays these days. But it does make the device a little less elegant.

## **Ergonomics > Legs**

Two foldable legs on the back allow it to be propped up at an angle. However, I just use a spare HUION stand for a better angle.

## **Pen**

It uses the new XP-Pen X3 Pro pen.

This pen feels nice to use and has typical min pressure (IAF) for non-wacom tablets. More here: [**pen pressure**](../../../guides/core-features/pen-pressure.md)&#x20;

## **Resolution**

Native resolution is 2560x1600

Excellent resolution. Big improvement over an HD screen.

## **Aspect Ratio**

It has a 16:10 aspect ratio instead of the much more common 16:9 aspect ratio.

After using it for a few days, I actually like the 16:10 aspect ratio.  &#x20;

## **Can be connected with a single USB-C cable?**

YES. I tried the cable that it came with and a Thunderbolt 3 cable. It worked in both cases.

## **Pointer lag**

Slightly better than normal for a pen display.

## **Line steadiness**

The line have a little bit of unsteadiness when moving slow.

I can mitigate that in Clip Studio paint by turning on the **Stabilization > Adjust by Speed** option and setting it to stabilize when drawing slowly.&#x20;

## **Express Keys**

None. But the tablet does come with a remote with programmable keys.

## **Pewn tracking > corner accuracy**

Very good

## **Diagonal wobble**

RATING: OK. Totally acceptable.
