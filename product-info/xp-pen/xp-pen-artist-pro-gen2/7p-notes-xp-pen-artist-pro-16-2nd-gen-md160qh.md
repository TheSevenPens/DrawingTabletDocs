# 7P notes: XP-Pen Artist Pro 16 GEN2 (MD160QH)

## **Overall**

In summary this is a very nice tablet. Wacom Cintiq Pro models are still better (and cost MUCH more) but this tablet is good overall and I have enjoyed using it.

## **Design**

RATING: EXCELLENT

I like the overall design. Looks and feels very premium.

One minor nit. The USB-C cable connects at the top edge this means you see the cable connect. This is normal for pen displays these days. But it does make the device a little less elegant.

## **Pen**&#x20;

The tablet comes with the the new **XP-Pen X3 Pro Pen**. It is incredibly similar in shape to the Wacom Pro Pen 2. Overall, this pen feels nice to use

## Pen pressure

**Pen IAF**: GOOD. IAF= 3gf (as stated by XP-Pen)

**Pen Max pressure:** GOOD. 380gf in my testing. I tested two pens. So probably, XP-Pen is designed this pen for 400gf max pressure. And my 380gf is just some natural variance.&#x20;

**Pressure transition instability** - VERY GOOD. Saw no "pulsing" at low pressure.

More here: [**pen pressure**](../../../guides/core-features/pen-pressure.md)&#x20;

## Pen features

**Pen eraser** -  HAS AN ERASER. I don't use erasers so I have no further comment about it.&#x20;

**Pen pressure levels** - 16K. Ignore this. it is hype. All you need is 2K pressure levels. More important than this is the wide pressure range (from IAF to Max pressure).

## **Display**&#x20;

**Resolution** - Native resolution is 2560x1600. Excellent resolution. Big improvement over an HD screen.

**Refresh rate** - TYPICAL. 60Hz. Normal for pen displays.

**Anti-glare sparkle -** GOOD. Low amount of AG sparkle. more here: [**Anti-glare sparkle**](../../../guides/pen-displays/anti-glare-sparkle.md).

**Sharpness** - GOOD. The AG treatment does not add any blurriness.

**Parallax** - GOOD. Little parallax.

**Aspect Ratio** - 16:10. So it is a little more squarish than the much more common 16:9 aspect ratio. After using it for a few days, I actually like the 16:10 aspect ratio.&#x20;

## **Connections and cabling**

**Single USB-C cable connection?**

YES. I tried the cable that it came with and a Thunderbolt 3 cable. It worked in both cases. More here: [Connecting a pen display with one USB-C cable](../../../guides/connections-and-cabling/connecting-a-pen-display-with-one-usb-c-cable.md)

## **Basics**

**Pointer lag -** TYPICAL. Slightly better than normal for a pen display.

**Line steadiness -** OK. The line have a little bit of unsteadiness when moving slow. I can mitigate that in Clip Studio paint by turning on the **Stabilization > Adjust by Speed** option and setting it to stabilize when drawing slowly.&#x20;

**Corner accuracy** VERY GOOD. Compared to other tablets has very minor inaccuracy at edges and corners.

## **Diagonal wobble**

RATING: OK. very slightly increase in wobble is slow strokes. Totally acceptable. A little brush smoothing eliminates it.

## **Ergonomics**

**Legs.** YES - It has two foldable legs on the back allow it to be propped up at an angle. However, I just use a spare HUION stand for a better angle.

## **Express Keys**

NONE. The tablet does come with a remote with programmable keys.
