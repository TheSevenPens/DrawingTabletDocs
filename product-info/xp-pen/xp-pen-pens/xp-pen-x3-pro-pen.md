# XP-Pen X3 Pro pen

## O**verview**&#x20;

The **XP-Pen X3 Pro Pen**. was introduced in 2023. It is incredibly similar in shape to the Wacom Pro Pen 2. Overall, this pen feels nice to use

## Pen pressure

**Pen IAF**: GOOD. IAF= 3gf (as stated by XP-Pen)

**Pen Max pressure:** GOOD. 380gf in my testing. I tested two pens. So probably, XP-Pen is designed this pen for 400gf max pressure. And my 380gf is just some natural variance.&#x20;

**Pressure transition instability** - VERY GOOD. Saw no "pulsing" at low pressure.

## Pen features

**Pen eraser** -  HAS AN ERASER. I don't use erasers so I have no further comment about it.&#x20;

**Pen pressure levels** - 16K. Ignore this. it is hype. All you need is 2K pressure levels. More important than this is the wide pressure range (from IAF to Max pressure).
