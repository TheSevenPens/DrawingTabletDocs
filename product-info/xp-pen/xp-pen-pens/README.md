# XP-Pen pens

## Pen / tablet compatibility list

XP-Pen maintains a list of pens and which tablets they are compatible with here: [https://www.xp-pen.com/series/stylus-pen-for-drawing-tablets.html](https://www.xp-pen.com/series/stylus-pen-for-drawing-tablets.html)

As always I recommend before purchasing any pen, you should <mark style="color:red;">**verify compatibility with XP Pen support**</mark>.
