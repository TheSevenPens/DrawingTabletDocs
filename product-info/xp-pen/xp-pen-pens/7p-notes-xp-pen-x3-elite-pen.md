# 7P notes: XP-Pen X3 Elite pen

## Overview

Pretty good - surprisingly good for a consumer level tablet. IAF could be a little better but not a big problem for me.

## Buttons

Two buttons on pen. It looks like one button - but it is a rocker switch so acts like two buttons.

## Eraser

No eraser.

## IAF

I'm not good at measuring IAF. Subjectively it is definitely higher IAF than a Wacom Pro Pen 2 (not surprising) and a little higher than a Huion PW517 pen.

## Max Pressure

I have three of these pens. The max pressure's measured very well.
