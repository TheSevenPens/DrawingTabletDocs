# 7P notes: Huion Inspiroy Frego M (L610)

## Overview

This is a great entry-level tablet. It does all the basics extremely well.&#x20;

* A good simple tablet. Nothing fancy.
* Good for beginners.&#x20;
* The pen it came with had a very wide pressure range. This is good. pen IAF was typical of Huion (i.e. slightly higher IAF than Wacom's pro pens).

### **Build quality and design** <a href="#build-quality-and-design" id="build-quality-and-design"></a>

Looks very simple and nice. Is very good. I wouldn't say it has a premium look.&#x20;

**Color** - matte black all around

**Huion branding** - On the front nothing is visible. One the back the Huion logo is very slightly visible as some recessed shiny black plastic..

**Lights**&#x20;

* green LED on upper right indicating USB connection
* blue LED on upper right indicating Bluetooth operation

## Pens

* Comes with the Huion PW550S pen.
* Default nib: felt.
  * I found this a little unusual because the tablet came with 10 replacement plastic nibs.&#x20;
* More here: [Huion PW550 series pens](../huion-pen-models/7p-notes-huion-pw550-series-pens.md)

## Other compatible pens

* You can use the Huion PW517 pen with this tablet. But it is not as good as the PW550 and PW550S.

## Pen pressure

* **IAF** - The specific pen I had seemed to have a typical IAF (I am not good at measuring) for a Huion PenTech 3.0+ pen. It seemed to be near 3gf as Huion stated.
* **Max pressure** - The max pressure of the PW550S that came with the tablet was very high - about 735gf.&#x20;

## Pointer lag

VERY LOW - Typical for a pen tablet. Just a tiny tiny bit more lag than a Wacom in my opinion. This lag is fine and will not affect drawing. &#x20;

## Touch

NONE. This tablet does NOT support touch.

## Auxiliary inputs&#x20;

The tablet has not buttons dials or sliders.

## Replaceable surface

No. The surface is not replaceable.

## Surface texture

Has a nice amount of surface texture.

**With a felt nib** - It feels like it has even more texture than a Wacom Intuos Pro (PTH-x60 series) which is widely known as having a heavily textured surface.

**With a plastic nib** - it felt like slightly less texture than a Wacom Intuos Pro (PTH-x60 series).

**Texture sound** - Moving the pen (with the felt nib installed) across the surface also produces a clearly audible squeaky sound. You may or may not like that. I prefer my tablets essentially silent. I switched to one of the plastic nibs and then it had a normal amount of noise and no squeaking.

## Cables and connections

**Wireless** - yes supports wireless via Bluetooth. I did not test this.

**Ports** - a single USB-C port in the upper-left edge.

## Ergonomics

* Bottom edge slops down a bit to make it more comfortable for your arm. This is starting to be seen more and more in recently released tablets.

## Diagonal wobble

EXCELLENT - almost no perceptible diagonal wobble.

## Recommended pressure curve

As is typical for EMR pens, I recommend a pressure curve to reduce the sensitivity at the low end of the physical pressure range.

## Pressure transition (low-high-low)

VERY GOOD. test with a 300px brush. Pressure smoothly transitions. A little bit of pressure wobble at the extreme low end of pressure when the pen is very vertical- but that is normal even for the best pens. Use a pressure curve to address it if needed.

## Pressure scan rate testing

EXCELLENT.  I drew 50 small strokes as fast as I could. The tablet registered all 50 strokes.

## Tilt Compensation

<mark style="color:red;">**TBD**</mark>

## Other features

**Pen holder** - a cloth loop affixed on the top edge serves as a convenient pen holder.
