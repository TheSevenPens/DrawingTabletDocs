# 7P notes: Huion Inspiroy Dial 2

**Summary**&#x20;

I really like this tablet. Drawing experience is good but what really sets it apart are the physical controls - especially the TWO dials on the left.

**ExpressKeys**

The dials make it easy to adjust things like brush size while painting.I tended to accidentally hit the lower dial with my forearm so I disabled that one.&#x20;
