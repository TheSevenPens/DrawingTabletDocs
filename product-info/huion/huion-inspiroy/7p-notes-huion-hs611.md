# 7P notes: Huion Inspiroy HS611

**Summary**

This is a slightly older Huion model from 2019 but is still a decent drawing tablet.&#x20;

If you get it, then it will work fine. But you should consider the newer Huion pen tablets at the same price point as the HS611.&#x20;

**Pen**

The tablet uses he the slightly older PW500 pen.&#x20;

**Design**

The HS611 lacks the refined look and feel of the newer Huion tablets.&#x20;

**Surface texture**

The drawing surface is very slightly textured. The texture feels smoother than the Wacom Intuos Pro (PTH-x60 series). But it is not as smooth as the surface of an iPad.

**ExpressKeys**

It has 10 programmable buttons on the left - more than most other tablets.

In addition, at the top there are some additional media control keys which are convenient.

**Diagonal wobble**

It does exhibit some wobble at slow speeds but in normal drawing I didn't notice it much.
