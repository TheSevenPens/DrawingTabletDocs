# 7P notes: Huion Inspiroy HS611

## **Summary**

This is a slightly older Huion model from 2019 but is still a decent drawing tablet.&#x20;

If you get it, then it will work fine. But you should consider the newer Huion pen tablets at the same price point as the HS611.&#x20;

## **Pen**

The tablet uses he the slightly older PW500 pen.&#x20;

## **Design**

The HS611 lacks the refined look and feel of the newer Huion tablets.&#x20;

## **Surface texture**

The drawing surface is very slightly textured. The texture feels smoother than the Wacom Intuos Pro (PTH-x60 series). But it is not as smooth as the surface of an iPad.

## **ExpressKeys**

It has 10 programmable buttons on the left - more than most other tablets.

In addition, at the top there are some additional media control keys which are convenient.

## **Diagonal wobble**

It exhibits some diagonal wobble. The wobble is most noticable at slower speeds.

In practice when I draw i did not notice this much.

Adding a little bit of brush smoothing controlled it.
