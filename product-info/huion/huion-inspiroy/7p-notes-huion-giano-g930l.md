# 7P notes: Huion Inspiroy Giano (G930L)

## **Summary**

Introduced in 2022, the Giano G930L is a fantastic value. It's quite nice for drawing and I enjoy the extra size.&#x20;

## **Compared to Wacom**

Its competitor is the Wacom Intuos Pro Large (PTH-860), and the Giano has some interesting differences:

* The Giano G930L costs about $200 where the Wacom Intuos Pro Large (PTH-860) costs about $500
* The Giano's active area is slightly larger than the Wacom Intuos Pro

## **Pen**

Comes with the Huion PW517 pen.&#x20;

## **Surface texture**

The tablet has a textured surface. Amount of texture comparable to the Wacom Intuos Pro.

## **Wireless**

One minor nit: By default, the tablet when connected will still go to sleep apparently to conserve its battery. This isn't a problem because you go into the driver and turn off this sleep behavior. &#x20;

## **OLED auxiliary display**

There's a monochromatic OLED auxiliary display on the upper left of the tablet. This is a nice feature that lets you see the battery level easily.

## **Working with a large tablet**

Large tablets require some adjustment to work with. More here: Using large pen tablets

## Pressure instability

Some pressure pulsing visible at lower pressure. Will mostly be be visible with strokes using large brushes.

## Diagonal wobble

Rating: VERY GOOD. low amounts of wobble.
