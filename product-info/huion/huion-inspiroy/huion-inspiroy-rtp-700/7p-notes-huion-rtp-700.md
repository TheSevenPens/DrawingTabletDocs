**Summary**

This tablet is a very basic tablet that has a solid drawing experience.

**Model year -** 2022

**Surface texture** - The surface texture is more prominent on this in terms of sound - which had a more audible scratchiness.

**ExpressKeys** - All the buttons are capacitive instead of physical. This makes for a nice looking surface. However, Which capacitive buttons it is difficult to know which button is being pressed without looking. Also it they can easily be accidentally "clicked."

**Design -** the look and feel of the tablet is really nice. It has an attractive, minimalist look and feels premium.&#x20;
