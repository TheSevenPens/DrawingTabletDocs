# Huion PW600 series pens

**Models**

* PW600
* PW600S
* PW600L

**Pen buttons**&#x20;

* PW600 has 3 buttons
* PW600S has 2 buttons
* PW600L has 3 buttons

**Pen button feel** - GOOD. the buttons on these pens have a nicer "crisper" clicking action than the buttons of the PW517 which feel a bit soft/mushy in comparison

**Pen IAF** - GOOD. Huion says 2gf for these pens. Seems accurate. A little more sensitive than the PW517 pen which is at about 3gf.

**Pen maximum pressure** -&#x20;

VERY GOOD.&#x20;

Huion states 500gf. I saw some variance around there - but everything was above 400gf which is good. Some of these are ROUGH measurements. I did these by hand instead of measuring with my testing gear.&#x20;

**PW600 seriescompatibility with older tablets** - The new pens are NOT compatible with older Huion tablets.

**Pen weight** - I measured with a digital scale

* PW600 = 16g
* PW600S = 14g
* PW517 = 14g

**Pen eraser**

the PW600 and PW600S pens do have an eraser. I don't user erasers so don't have any particular comment on it.

The PW600L does NOT have an eraser.
