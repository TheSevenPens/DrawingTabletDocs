# 7P notes: Huion PW500 pen

## Overall

Overall it performs decently. No obvious problems

## Design

The pen is a little "plastic-feeling" and does not have a premium feeling.&#x20;

The nib retracts a little more than than more modern EMR pens. It doesn't impact drawing, but it some people may not like the more "spongy" feeling.

## Max pressure

Max pressure is OK at around \~250gf with the unit I tested.
