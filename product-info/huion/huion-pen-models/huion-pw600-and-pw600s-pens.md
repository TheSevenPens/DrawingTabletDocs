# Huion PW600 and PW600S

**Pen buttons** - GOOD. the PW600 has 3 buttons. The PW600S has two buttons.

**Pen button feel** - GOOD. the buttons on both pens have a nicer "crisper" clicking action than the buttons of the PW517 which feel a bit soft/mushy in comparison

**Pen IAF** - GOOD. Huion says 2gf for both pens. Seems accurate. A little more sensitive than the PW517 pen which is at about 3gf.

**Pen maximum pressure** - VERY GOOD. I measured both pens at 510gf (slightly \*more\* than the 500gf that Huion specified). This amount of variance is normal.

**PW600/PW600S compatibility with older tablets** - The new pens are NOT compatible with older Huion tablets.

**Pen weight** - I measured with a digital scale

* PW600 = 16g
* PW600S = 14g
* PW517 = 14g

**Pen eraser** - the PW600 and PW600S pens do have an eraser. I don't user erasers so don't have any particular comment on it.
