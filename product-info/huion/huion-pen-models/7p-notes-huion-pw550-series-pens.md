## Buttons

These pens have two buttons which is typical for an EMR pen.

## Pressure testing notes

I tested four PW550 series pens on 2024/08/30

* 1x PW500S
* 4x PW550

## Pressure: IAF &#x20;

I'm not good at measuring IAF but each seemed to be around 3gf.

## Pressure: max pressure (approximate)

3 of 4 of the my PW550 pens have GOOD or EXCELLENT max pressure. One outlier has an OK max pressure.

| BRAND | PEN    | INVENTORY | PHYSICAL | LOGICAL |
| ----- | ------ | --------- | -------- | ------- |
| HUION | PW550  | HU1006    | 560.0gf  | 99.0%   |
| HUION | PW550  | HU1008    | 223.6gf  | 99.99%  |
| HUION | PW550  | HU1009    | 850.0gf  | 100.0%  |
| HUION | PW550S | HU1007    | 735.5gf  | 99.4%   |

## Pressure: Response curve

As is typical for EMR pens, these pens have a response that bows up. All 4 hit 50% at around 100gf.

So as I often recommend, you should consider a pressure curve to linearize this response so that you have more pressure control at the lower end of the physical pressure range.
