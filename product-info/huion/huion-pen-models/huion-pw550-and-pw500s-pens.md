# Huion PW550 and PW500S pens



## Testing notes

I tested four PW550 series pens on 2024/08/30

* 1x PW500S
* 4x PW550

## Pressure: IAF &#x20;

I'm not good at measuring IAF but each seemed to be around 3gf.

## Pressure: Max Pressure



* PW550 - 223.6gf
* PW550 - 560.0gf
* PW550 - 850.0gf
* PW500S - 735.5gf

## Pressure: Response curve

As is typical for EMR pens, these pens have a response that bows up. All 4 hit 50% at around 100gf.

So as I often recommend, you should consider a pressure curve to linearize this response so that you have more pressure control at the lower end of the physical pressure range.
