**Anti-glare sparkle**

The only issue with this tablet is that it exhibits <mark style="color:red;">**the strongest anti-glare sparkle that I have ever seen**</mark> in any device.&#x20;

I'm not even typically sensitive to anti-glare sparkle. I can tolerate a lot of it. It took me several weeks to adjust to adjust to this. I mostly don't mind it now. Some of you will surely hate the amount of sparkle, and mainy people complain about this model for this reason.

**General**

In all other ways, I was satisfied with this tablet.

**Using one USB-C cable**

I was able to use this with a single Thunderbolt 3 USB-C cable. But one of my computers could supply enough power for it with that cable, and one of my computers could not.&#x20;
