# 7P notes: Huion Kamvas Pro 19 (GT1902)

Please keep in mind these are my initial reactions on my first day of using the tablet.

**Weight** - lighter than I expected. I noticed it immediately when I picked up the box.&#x20;

**Display > Anti-Glare sparkle** - BIG IMPROVEMENT over some older Huion models. Slightly noticeable at 4 to 5 inches. At normal drawing distance for me not noticeable. I am very happy with the outcome.

**Pressure Transition Instability** - You may remember the issues I pointed out with the Huion Inspiroy 2 L and the Wacom One M. That the problem is not visible with this tablet and pen. Remember: All tablets have some amount of it. Great tablets just have a very small amount of it and you have to construct situations to reveal it. This tablet so far seems comparable to what I see with the Wacom Intuos Pro & Cintiq Pro tablets.&#x20;

**Compatibility with the older PW517 pen** - not compatible. Or at least not completely compatible. The PW517 pen will move the pointer, but not there is no pressure detected so drawing is useless.

**Cabling** - I could not use it with a single USB-C cable. Huion did not say that single-cable operation was a feature - so I am not surprised. Tablets above 16 inches generally require additional power.

* Power: I have it connected with its USB-C power cable to the provided power adapter.
* Data and display signal: I connected it with a Cable Matters Thunderbolt 3 cable to my Microsoft Surface Thunderbolt Dock which is then connected to a M3 MacBook Pro.

**Pens** - comes with the PW600 and PW600S pens. Having two pens is convenient.

**Touch on MacOS** - DOES NOTHING. Which is what Huion said it would do. So no surprise.

**Touch on Windows** - Will try this soon.

**PW600 and PW660S pen max pressure** - 510gf (slightly \*more\* than Huion specified).&#x20;
