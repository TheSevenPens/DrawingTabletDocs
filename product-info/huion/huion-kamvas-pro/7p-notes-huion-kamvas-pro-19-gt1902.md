# 7P notes: Huion Kamvas Pro 19 (GT1902)

Please keep in mind these are my initial reactions on my first day of using the tablet.

## Recommendation

NO STATEMENT YET.  I am still actively evaluating this tablet. Overall experience so far is positive.

## Basics

* **Corner/Edge accuracy** - NORMAL. Good on the right side, a little more inaccurate on the left. These affects are only in the last 2mm and should did not affect my normal usage of the tablet.
* **Pointer lag** - NORMAL - standard for modern pen displays.
* **Parallax** - NORMAL - standard for modern pen displays.



## Diagonal wobble

GOOD. LOW amounts of wobble in stroke.

## **Display**

**Refresh rate** - NORMAL. Up to 60Hz which is standard for pen displays in 2024. Does not support 120Hz.

**Anti-Glare sparkle** - OK. This is a big. BIG IMPROVEMENT over some older Huion models. Slightly noticeable at 6 inches. At normal drawing distance for me not noticeable. I am very happy with the outcome.&#x20;

**Sharpness** - OK. the anti-glare treatment diffuses the light coming from the display. The result is that the pixels on the display are "soft" and not as crisp as on comparable 16" or 22" displays. Several other people with this tablet have commented on the same thing. For me this is not a problem.&#x20;

## Compatibility

**Backwards compatibility with the older PW517 pen** - not compatible. Or at least not completely compatible. The PW517 pen will move the pointer, but not there is no pressure detected so drawing is useless.

## **Connections**

I could not use it with a single USB-C cable. Huion did not say that single-cable operation was a feature - so I am not surprised. Tablets above 16 inches generally require additional power.

* Power: I have it connected with its USB-C power cable to the provided power adapter.
* Data and display signal: I connected it with a Cable Matters Thunderbolt 3 cable to my Microsoft Surface Thunderbolt Dock which is then connected to a M3 MacBook Pro.

##



## Touch

* **Touch on MacOS** - DOES NOTHING. Which is what Huion said it would do. So no surprise.
* **Touch on Windows** - Still evaluating.
  * ONE ISSUE: Touch on the tablet will map to whichever display is your "main monitor". Huion should change this in the driver so that touch will always map to the pen display regardless of what is selected as your main monitor.&#x20;

## **Ergonomics**

**Weight** - lighter than I expected. I noticed it immediately when I picked up the box.&#x20;

**VESA mounting** - YES. There are VESA holes for mounting on the back

**Legs** - YES. Two legs

**Noise** - GOOD. No noise because no fans

**Heat** - EXCELLENT. After running at 100% brightness for 12 hours: room temperature on the left side. Just very slightly warmer on the right.&#x20;

## Pens and Pressure

**Pens** - comes with the PW600 and PW600S pens.&#x20;

**Driver &** Pens - the driver knows that there are two different pen models and has separate button settings for each. However settings like the driver pressure curve are the shared across both pens.&#x20;

**Pen buttons** - GOOD. the PW600 has 3 buttons. The PW600S has two buttons.

**Pen button feel** - GOOD. the buttons on both pens have a nicer "crisper" clicking action than the buttons of the PW517 which feel a bit soft/mushy in comparison

**Pen IAF** - GOOD. Huion says 2gf for both pens. Seems accurate. A little more sensitive than the PW517 pen which is at about 3gf.

**Pen maximum pressure** - VERY GOOD. I measured both pens at 510gf (slightly \*more\* than the 500gf that Huion specified). This amount of variance is normal.

**Pressure Transition Instability** - VERY GOOD. You may remember the issues I pointed out with the Huion Inspiroy 2 L and the Wacom One M. That the problem is not visible with this tablet and pen. Remember: All tablets have some amount of it. Desirable tablets just have a very small amount of it and you have to construct situations to reveal it. This tablet so far seems comparable to what I see with the Wacom Intuos Pro & Cintiq Pro tablets.&#x20;
