# 7P notes: Huion Kamvas 22 Plus (GS2202)

**Summary**

The Huion Kamvas 22 is one of the best price-to-performance pen displays in the market.&#x20;

NOTE: In 2023, with the arrival of the XP-Pen Artist 22 Plus (MD220FH) though, I think the XP-Pen is an even better choice because of the improved pressure handling of the XP-Pen X3 Pro pen.

**Price** - It normally costs about $450 but I see it discounted often to $400

**Size** - 22" is perfect for me. Not too big and not too small for the kind of drawing I do.

**Resolution** - With a 1920x1080 display, it looks slightly pixelated. But I don't find that a problem while drawing. My ideal pen display would have the same 22" size but with 2560x1440 resolution

**Pointer lag** - normal for a pen display

**Express Keys** - It has none. So, I use keyboard shorts with this device: [tourbox](../../../accessories/tourbox/)

**Corner Accuracy** - Seems to me about +/- 3mm. A little on the high side, but it will not interfere with drawing.

**Parallax** - low.&#x20;

**Stand** - comes with a basic stand. Nothing fancy. but works great.

**Monitor Arm** - I have my Kamvas 22 plus mounted to an Ergotron LX. It works great. I especially like that it can lower the tablet enough that the bottom edge can rest on the desk. This adds for some extra stability.

**Anti-glare sparkle -** very minimal. Not noticeable.&#x20;

**Scenario**

I originally bought this tablet for digital art, and it works fine for that.

Over time I have it setup on my work desk on an arm. I use it as an external display but I pull it in closer when I want to draw on a whiteboard during an online meeting. I still occasionally sketch and paint on it, but since it is on my work desk I don't do as much of it as I used to.

**Heat** - display stays cool. I leave it on 24/7 and it has no hot spots.

**3-in-1 cable**

It comes with a proprietary 3-in-1 cable.&#x20;

As the user manual illustrates. You cannot use this with a single USB-C cable or even two USB-C cables. You must always use the 3-in-1 cable in some form for power. Sometimes I have set it up with the 3-in-1 cable connected in the top USB-C port and then the power end connected to the wall. And in the bottom port, I use a Thunderbolt 3 cable to get the display signal and data to the pen display.

**Diagonal wobble** - very good. has extremely low wobble.
