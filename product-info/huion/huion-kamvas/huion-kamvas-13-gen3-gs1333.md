# Huion Kamvas 13 (GEN3) (GS1333)

<mark style="color:red;">**NOTE: I just received this tablet on 2024/09/17 so I have just started looking through it. This evaluation is still IN PROGRESS**</mark>

## Overview

<mark style="color:red;">DRAFT: So far this tablet has performed extremely well in my limited testing. If there are no major issues, I think it will likely be on by recommended list and one I easily recommend for a beginner or consumer level tablet.</mark>

## Basics

* product page: [https://huion.com/products/pen\_display/Kamvas/kamvas-13-gen-3.html](https://huion.com/products/pen\_display/Kamvas/kamvas-13-gen-3.html)
* released: 2024

## Display

* Native resolution: 1920x1080
* Refresh rate: 60Hz
* Brightness: 220 nit

## Anti-glare treatment

The tablet is etched glass. This is a change from previous model which used an AG matte film.

## Anti-glare sparkle

&#x20;Very little visible. This is a big improvement over the previous model.

## Display sharpness

Pixels are clear and well delineated. The image does not look "soft".

## Pen

* 1x PW600L pen

## Pointer lag

TYPICAL for a pen display.&#x20;

The pointer lag did not intefere with my drawing in any way.

## Compatible pens

The PenTech 4.0 pens work with it. I tested these three:

* PW600L
* PW600
* PW600S

## Pen tracking accuracy

Huion states:

* Center :±0.3mm
* Corner:  ±2mm

RATING: VERY GOOD

I found the pen tracking very accurate. The pointer follows the tip of the pen very accurately across the entire surface. And in my unit, the corners seemed even more accurate than ±2mm.&#x20;

## Tilt compensation

RATING: VERY GOOD

* At 45 degrees of tilt - I saw almost deflection of pointer away from the tip of the nib
* At 60 degrees of tilt - It was still very good - sometimes as good at 45 degrees - though sometimes I saw maybe a 1mm deflection

## Touch

N/A. This tablet does NOT support touch.

## Surface texture

GOOD. Provides good grip for the - even if the pen is using the plastic nib. Surface texture seems comparable to the Kamvas Pro 19 - actually the Kamvas 13 GEN3 seems to have slightly more texture.

## Pressure scan rate

GOOD. I drew 50 small quick strokes as fast as I could. No strokes were lost.&#x20;

## Diagonal wobble

RATING: EXCELLENT. Very minimal diagonal wobble.

## Connections and cabling

### Ports

* 2x USB-C ports
* Upper USB-C port is recessed into the tablet. Intended for use with the Huion 3-in-1 cable
* Lower USB-C port is flush against the surface of the tablet and intended for use with a USB-C cable

## VESA

This tablet does NOT support VESA mounting.

## Legs

This tablet does NOT have legs.

## Heat

I set the brightness to 100% and continued to use the tablet for 1 hour.

The left 2/3rds of the tablet felt like room temperature to my hands.

The right 1/3 of the tablet got slightly  warm - most of that was closer to the USB-C port locations. The warmth did not concern me and seemed very normal for pen display.&#x20;

## Audio

This tablet does not have any audio features and does not have a headphone jack.
