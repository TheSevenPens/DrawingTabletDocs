# 7P notes: Huion Kamvas 22 Plus (GS2202)

## **Summary**

The Huion Kamvas 22 is one of the best price-to-performance pen displays in the market.&#x20;

NOTE: In 2023, with the arrival of the XP-Pen Artist 22 Plus (MD220FH) though, I think the XP-Pen is an even better choice because of the improved pressure handling of the XP-Pen X3 Pro pen.

## Basics

* Model number: GS2202
* Release year: 2020
* Active area: 22" diagonal
* **Price** - It normally costs about $450 but I see it discounted often to $400

## Display basics

* Size: 22" diagonal
* Aspect ratio: 16x9
* Display panel tech: IPS
* Bit depth: 8bpp
* Anti-glare treatment: Etched glass
* Laminated: YES

## Pen

* Pen model id: PW517

## Pointer lag

TYPICAL. - normal for a pen display.

## Express Keys

**NONE**. So, I use keyboard shorts with this device: [tourbox](../../../accessories/auxiliary-input-devices/tourbox/)

## Pen tracking accuracy

* **Center accuracy -** GOOD. I did not measure
* **Corner Accuracy** - Seems to me about +/- 3mm. A little on the high side, but it will not interfere with drawing.

## **Display > Parallax**

GOOD - low.

## **Display > Anti-glare sparkle**

VERY GOOD. very minimal. Not noticeable. &#x20;

## **Display other**

* Pixelation - With a 1920x1080 display, it looks slightly pixelated. But I don't find that a problem while drawing. My ideal pen display would have the same 22" size but with 2560x1440 resolution
* Dead pixels - none detected
* Display sharpness - VERY GOOD. pixels clear and well delineated

## VESA

Supports VESA mounting

I have my Kamvas 22 plus mounted to an Ergotron LX. It works great. I especially like that it can lower the tablet enough that the bottom edge can rest on the desk. This adds for some extra stability.

## **Stand**

Comes with a basic stand that attaches via VESA mounting. Nothing fancy. but works great.

## **Legs**

Tablet has no legs.

## **Scenario**

I originally bought this tablet for digital art, and it works fine for that.

Over time I have it setup on my work desk on an arm. I use it as an external display but I pull it in closer when I want to draw on a whiteboard during an online meeting. I still occasionally sketch and paint on it, but since it is on my work desk I don't do as much of it as I used to.

## **Ergonomics**

**Heat -** display stays cool. I leave it on 24/7 and it has no hot spots.

**Fan noise**- NONE. It has no fans

**Touch** - it does NOT have touch support



## **Connections and Cabling**

**3-in-1 cable**

It comes with a proprietary 3-in-1 cable.&#x20;

As the user manual illustrates. You cannot use this with a single USB-C cable or even two USB-C cables. You must always use the 3-in-1 cable in some form for power. Sometimes I have set it up with the 3-in-1 cable connected in the top USB-C port and then the power end connected to the wall. And in the bottom port, I use a Thunderbolt 3 cable to get the display signal and data to the pen display.

## **Diagonal wobble**&#x20;

very good. has extremely low wobble.
