# 7P notes: Huion Frego M (L610)

## Overview

<mark style="color:red;">**THIS tablet is still under review.**</mark>

A good basic tablet. The PW550S had a very good pressure range.

## Basics

Product page: [https://www.huion.com/products/pen\_tablet/Inspiroy/Inspiroy-Frego-M.html](https://www.huion.com/products/pen\_tablet/Inspiroy/Inspiroy-Frego-M.html)&#x20;

## Size <a href="#size" id="size"></a>

This is a medium-sized tablet - with an active area slightly larger than Wacom Intuos Pro Medium (PTH-660).

### **Build quality and design** <a href="#build-quality-and-design" id="build-quality-and-design"></a>

Looks very simple and nice. Is very good, but I wouldn't say it has a premium look.&#x20;

**Color** - matte black all around

**Huion branding** - On the front nothing is visible. One the back the Huion logo is very slightly visible as some recessed shiny black plastic..

**Lights**&#x20;

* green LED on upper right indicating USB connection
* blue LED on upper right indicating Bluetooth operation

## Pens

* Comes with the Huion PW550S pen.
* More here: [Huion PW550 and PW550S pens](../huion-pen-models/huion-pw550-and-pw550s-pens.md)

## Pen pressure

* **IAF** - The specific pen I had seemed to have a typical IAF (I am not good at measuring) for a Huion PenTech 3.0+ pen. It seemed to be near 3gf as Huion stated.
* **Max pressure** - The max pressure of the PW550S that came with the tablet was very high - about 735gf.&#x20;
* **Nib** - The included PW600S had a felt nib installed by default.

## Pointer lag

VERY LOW - Typical for a pen tablet. Just a tiny tiny bit more lag than a Wacom.

## Auxiliary inputs&#x20;

The tablet has not buttons dials or sliders.

## Replaceable surface

No. The surface is not replaceable.

## Surface texture

Very textured surface. Combined with the felt nib, it has a lot of texture. Even with the plastic nib the texture was strongly present.

In comparison the Huion Frego, is one of the most textured pen tablets I've encountered. I felt it had more surface texture than a Wacom Intuos Pro (PTH-x60 series).

The moving the pen across the surface also produces a clearly audible scratching sound. You may or may not like that. I prefer my tablets essentially silent.

Longevity - my experience with the texture on the Wacom Intuos Pro is that (1) the texture can really eat through nibs if you are drawing on them in certain ways. (2) the texture will wear down over time leaving "glossy" areas on the tablet which still work perfectly but have lost their texture. Only time will tell if the Frego will exhibit the same behaviors.

## Cables and connections

**Wireless** - yes supports wireless via Bluetooth. I did not test this.

**Ports** - a single USB-C

## Industrial design

**Color** - matte black everywhere

## Ergonomics

* Bottom edge slops down a bit to make it more comfortable for your arm

## Diagonal wobble

TBD - Not tested yet

## Other features

**Pen holder** - a cloth loop affixed on the top edge serves as a convenient pen holder.
