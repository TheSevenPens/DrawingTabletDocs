<mark style="color:red;">**TBD**</mark>

## **Basics**

* **Product page:** [**https://www.xencelabs.com/us/products/pen-display**](https://www.xencelabs.com/us/products/pen-display)
* **Release year: 2023**

## **Setup**

Insert photo



## **Display > basics**

* Screen size: 23.8in (60.5cm)
* Lamination - YES
* Refresh rate - max 60Hz
* Resolution: 3840x2160
* Brightness:  unknown

## **Edge & Corner accuracy**&#x20;

Rating: VERY GOOD.&#x20;

Extremely accurate at edges and in corners. Among the best I've seen.&#x20;

* Better than my Wacom Cintiq Pro 27 (which is also VERY GOOD).
* Clearly better than Huion Kamvas 24 Pro 4K (which is TYPICAL)&#x20;

## **Anti-glare treatment**

It uses an etched-glass surface.

It does a very good job of reducing glare.

In comparison:

* a bit more glare reduction than the Cintiq Pro 22
* around the same as the Huion Kamvas Pro 19&#x20;

## **Anti-glare sparkle**

Rating: VERY GOOD. \[LESS IS BETTER]&#x20;

Slight AG Sparkle only noticeable when eye is \~4" away from glass or closer. At normal drawing distance not visible..&#x20;

* On par with Wacom Cintiq Pro 27 (Which is GOOD).&#x20;
* Clearly better than with Huion Kamvas 24 Pro 4K (Which is OK)&#x20;

## **Color modes**

* AdobeRGB
* sRGB
* REC 709
* DCI P3
* REC 2020
* Pantone
* User mode

### **sRGB mode**

I used this display in only in SRGB mode.

When setting sRGB mode the brightness stayed steady. Some pen displays and monitors reduce the brightness in sRGB mode, but that did not happen with this tablet.&#x20;

## **Pointer Lag**

Rating: Slightly above TYPICAL RANGE&#x20;

Comparisons:

* Wacom Cintiq Pro has a bit less lag.&#x20;
* Comparable to but the Huion Kamvas 24 Pro 4K (Which is Typical) - maybe just a little more than the Huion.&#x20;

## **Surface  texture**

Rating: VERY GOOD. It feels really nice.

With a plastic nib

* Slightly more texture than the Cintiq Pro 27.
* More texture than Huion Kamvas Pro 19
* More texture than Huion Kamvas Pro 24 4K

With a felt nib

* Felt comparable to the Huion Kamvas Pro 19

## **Pens**

**More here:** [**7P notes: Xencelabs V2 pens**](7p-notes-xencelabs-v2-pens.md)&#x20;

### Pressure range

These have a nice pressure range:

* IAF: 3gf Xencelabs specifies 3gf. That felt accurate. Typical for a non-Wacom pen and low enough for me. Wacom Pro Pen 2 min pressure is <1gf.&#x20;
* MAX pressure: 500gf&#x20;

## Pressure Transition

Moving from very light pressure to heavy pressure works well, the pressure moves up and down smoothly. Staying in low pressure works well - no add bumps or pulsing in strokes.

## Pressure scan rate

I draw 50 strokes as fast as I could - similar to crosshatching quickly. No strokes were missed.

## **General wobble**&#x20;

In general to the position of the pointer wobbles a little bit as you move your pen. This happens at all angles - not just diagonal angles. Even vertical or horizontal lines exhibit the wobble. This wobble occurs at all velocities of the pen, but diminishes a little bit  if the pen is moving fast.

The wobble is easily seen noticable to the eyes.

In comparison the wobble for horizontal and vertical lines is:

* clearly more than the Huion Kamvas Pro 19 (which is excellent)
* clearly more than the Cintiq Pro 27 (which excellent)

**Horizontal line examples (the same happens with vertical lines)**

## **Diagonal wobble**

NOTE: Keep in mind the general wobble describes contributes to the diagonal wobble.

Rating: OK. There is more diagonal wobble than comparable tablets.&#x20;

Diagonal wobble effects all tablets, and it tends to be present in pen displays more often especially as they get larger. But here I am seeing two things:

* There is a bit more wobble than I would expect.&#x20;
* The additional wobble happens even with faster strokes.&#x20;

Compared to other tablets

* Has noticeably more than the Huion Kamvas Pro 19
* Has a bit more wobble than Wacom Cintiq Pro 27
* Has a bit more wobble than the Huion Kamvas Pro 24 4K
* Has a bit more wobble than the XP-Pen &#x20;

## Xencelabs awareness of wobble

Xencelabs is at least aware of the diagonal wobble.

In this review post on reddit (posted July 12, 2023) there are some quoted responses from  Xencelabs[https://www.reddit.com/r/drawingtablet/comments/14y8xl7/xencelabs\_pen\_display\_24\_review/](https://www.reddit.com/r/drawingtablet/comments/14y8xl7/xencelabs\_pen\_display\_24\_review/)&#x20;

It's unclear if they are aware of the more general wobble I encountered.

## **Driver**

### Driver UX

Rating: EXCELLENT&#x20;

The best user experience and design of any tablet in the industry.

## Multiple tablets on same computer

The tablet driver does work correctly if multiple Xencelabs products are plugged into the computer at the same time.

I tested with these tablets plugged in at the same time:

* Xencelabs Pen Display 24
* Xencelabs Pen Tablet Medium&#x20;

## **Pen**

### Pens in the box

This tablet comes with two pens:&#x20;

* Xencelabs 3 Button Pen V2
* Xencelabs Thin Pen V2

That these pens are different than the one that comes with the Xencelabs pen tablet. And the pens are NOT swappable.&#x20;

### Pen buttons

This new  3 Button Pen V2 is an improvement from the old V1 pen. The buttons are more prominent and easier to tell apart by touch.

### Pen eraser

Both pens have an eraser. But I don't user erasers so I have no comment on them.

## **Hover distance**&#x20;

Rating: TYPICAL. I measured it at 10mm.

## Fans

No fans.&#x20;

## Noise

Completely quiet. No noise.

## Heat

After leaving it on for 3 hours with brightness set at 100%, the overall surface has a slightly warm feel - close to body temperature.
