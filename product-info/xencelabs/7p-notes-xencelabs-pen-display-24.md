# 7P notes: Xencelabs Pen Display 24 (LPH2412U-A)

## Overview

<mark style="color:red;">**I AM CURRENTLY EVALUATING THIS TABLET. MY CURRENT EVALUATION IS BELOW BUT MAY CHANGE AS I USE IT MORE.**</mark>

## **Hover distance**&#x20;

Rating: TYPICAL. I measured it at 10mm.

## **Edge & Corner accuracy**&#x20;

Rating: VERY GOOD.&#x20;

Extremely accurate at edges and in corners. Among the best I've seen.&#x20;

* Better than Wacom Cintiq Pro 27 (which is also VERY GOOD).
* Clearly better than Huion Kamvas 24 Pro 4K (which is TYPICAL)&#x20;

## **Anti-glare sparkle**

Rating: VERY GOOD. \[LESS IS BETTER]&#x20;

Slight AG Sparkle only noticeable when eye is \~4" away from glass or closer. At normal drawing distance not visible.&#x20;

* On par with Wacom Cintiq Pro 27 (Which is GOOD).&#x20;
* Clearly better than with Huion Kamvas 24 Pro 4K (Which is OK)&#x20;

## **Color**

I am not a color expert.&#x20;

The one GREAT thing I noticed is that it's sRGB mode doesn't dim the brightness of the display. So many other pen displays and monitors don't reduce brightness in sRGB mode. So, this is very nice to have.&#x20;

## **Pointer Lag**

Rating: Slightly above TYPICAL RANGE&#x20;

Comparisons:

* Wacom Cintiq Pro has a bit less lag.&#x20;
* Comparable to but the Huion Kamvas 24 Pro 4K (Which is Typical) - maybe just a little more than the Huion.&#x20;

## **Surface  texture**

Rating: VERY GOOD. It feels really nice.

* Slightly more texture than the Cintiq Pro 27.&#x20;

## **Pen pressure**

### **Min pressure (IAF)**

Rating: TYPICAL. Xencelabs specifies 3gf. That felt accurate. Typical for a non-Wacom pen and low enough for me. Wacom Pro Pen 2 min pressure is <1gf.&#x20;

### **Max pressure**

Rating: VERY GOOD

I will be measuring this soon. But overall it feels like 400gf or 500gf.

* Wacom Pro Pen 2 has higher max pressure at 800gf.
* Huion's PW600 and P600S pens have a comparable max pressure of 500gf.
* XP-Pen pro pen has a comparable max pressure of 400gf.

## **Diagonal wobble**

Rating: WORSE THAN AVERAGE

Currently seeing a lot diagonal wobble at both slow and medium drawing speeds that requires smoothing to reduce.&#x20;

## **Driver**

### Driver UX

Rating: EXCELLENT&#x20;

The best user experience and design of any tablet in the industry.

## Multiple tablets on same computer

Currently the driver cannot handle multiple Xencelabs products attached at the same time. I tried with a Xencelabs Pen Display 24 and a Xencelabs Pen Tablet Medium and the driver showed a message saying only one could be used at one time.&#x20;

## **Pen**

### Pens in the box

This tablet comes with two pens:&#x20;

* Xencelabs Pen V2
* Xencelabs Pen Slim V2

That these pens are different than the one that comes with the Xencelabs pen tablet. And the pens are NOT swappable.&#x20;

## Buttons

This new Pen V2 is an improvement from the old V1 pen. The buttons are more prominent and easier to tell apart by touch.
