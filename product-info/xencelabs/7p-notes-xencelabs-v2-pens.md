# 7P notes: Xencelabs V2 pens

## Summary

These are good performing pens with a wide pressure range.

Models

* 3 Button Pen + Eraser v2 (XMCPH35)
* Thin Pen + Eraser v2 (XMCPH36)

### **Min pressure (IAF)**

Rating: TYPICAL. Xencelabs specifies 3gf. That felt accurate. Typical for a non-Wacom pen and low enough for me. Wacom Pro Pen 2 min pressure is <1gf.&#x20;

### **Max pressure**

Rating: VERY GOOD

Xencelabs has indicated their max pressure should be 500gf. And I found that to be accurate. There is some variation - the Thin pen had an even wider pressure range than Xencelabs claimed (which is good).

* 3 Button Pen + Eraser v2 (XMCPH35) -> my unit measured at 500gf
* Thin Pen + Eraser v2 (XMCPH36) -> my unit measured at 600gf

In comparison

* Wacom Pro Pen 2 has higher max pressure at 800gf.
* Huion's PW600 and P600S pens have a comparable max pressure of 500gf.
* XP-Pen X3 Pro pen has a comparable max pressure of 400gf.
