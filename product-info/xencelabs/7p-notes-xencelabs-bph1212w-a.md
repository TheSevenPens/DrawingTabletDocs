# 7P notes: Xencelabs Pen Tablet Medium (BPH1212W-A)

**Summary**

Had a good experience with this tablet after using for six months.

It's in the same price range as Wacom.

**Build quality**&#x20;

Rating: very good.&#x20;

Comparable to Wacom Intuos Pro GEN2.

**Basic drawing**&#x20;

Rating: very good.&#x20;

I forgot I wasn't using a Wacom Intuos Pro tablet.

**Driver**&#x20;

Rating: Excellent

Driver UX is very friendly and modern in appearance.

**Diagonal Wobble**

Rating: OK - LOW-ISH

I did see some wobble at all speeds though it diminished at higher speeds. This amount of wobble could be a bit better for a pro tablet.&#x20;

You might notice this wobble if you are doing line art or very careful strokes.&#x20;

You can eliminate this wobble with Smoothing:

* Krita Brush Smoothing&#x20;
  * **Basic** smoothing was enough to remove it
  * **Weighted** with **Distance** = 130 got rid of it
* &#x20;**Clip Studio Paint**&#x20;
  * Stabilization of 50 got rid of it
