# Wacom One vs One by Wacom

If you are new to Wacom, you should understand this issue because it is a constant source of confusion for people looking to buy a Wacom tablet, get help with a Wacom tablet, or buy a replacement pen for their Wacom tablet.

The problem: Wacom makes two very different devices with confusingly similar names:

**"One by Wacom"** refers to any of 2 pen tablets

* One by Wacom Small (CTL-472)&#x20;
* One by Wacom medium (CTL-672)&#x20;

**"Wacom One"** can refer to any of 5 drawing tablets in two generations

* Wacom One GEN1 (DTC-133) - a pen display&#x20;
* Wacom One 12 GEN2 (DTC-121) - a pen display
* Wacom One 13 touch GEN2 (DTH-134) - a pen display
* Wacom One S GEN2 (CTC-4110WL) - a pen tablet&#x20;
* Wacom One M GEN2 (CTC-6110WL) - a pen tablet
