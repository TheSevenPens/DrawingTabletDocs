# Wacom tablet list

## Overview

Wacom has existed for over 40 years. In that time they've released many different drawing tablets.

In this document I'll point you to different lists of tablets depending on what you're interested in.

## Wacom's official current tablet models

You can see a list of all the tablets Wacom currently sells on their website ([https://www.wacom.com](https://www.wacom.com)). However, this information does not cover the tablets they historically sold.
