# 7P notes: Wacom One Pen GEN2 (CP-923)

## Overview

Wacom introduced this pen in 2023. It is a terrible pen. Because of of how it handles pressure. I prefer using the Wacom One Pen GEN1 (CP-913) instead.

Officially the name of the CP-923 pen is "Wacom One Standard Pen"  but that name is confusing so I will call it one of the two following names:

* Wacom One Pen (GEN2)
* CP-923

### The Old Wacom One Pen (CP-913)

Below is the old Wacom One Pen (CP-913). It is better than the CP-913. It only has one button but the pressure handling is much better.

### **Pen support**

* All the Wacom One (Gen 2) tablets are compatible with the new Wacom One Pen (Gen 2).
* This is good. It eliminates a huge source of confusion around pen compatibility.

### **Pen evolution**

* One by Wacom (CTL-472, CTL-672) -> Wacom Pen 2K (LP-190K)
* Intuos (CTL-4100\*, CTL-6100\*) -> Wacom Pen 4K (LP-1100K)
* Wacom One Pen (Gen 1) -> CP91300B2Z
* Wacom One Pen (Gen 2) -> CP92303B2Z

### **Pressure levels**

* One by Wacom (CTL-472, CTL-672) -> 2048
* Intuos (CTL-4100\*, CTL-6100\*) -> 4096
* Wacom One (Gen 1) -> 4096
* Wacom One (Gen 2) -> 4096

So no improvements to pen pressure levels. As a reminder, all you really need are 2048 pressure levels and it is the pressure range that is more important.

### **Number of pen buttons**

* New pen (CP-923) -> 2 buttons
* Old pen (CP-913) -> 1 button

### **Tilt**

* New pen (CP-923) -> supports tilt
* Old pen (CP-913) -> does not support tilt

## Compatibility

### Backwards compatibility

* New pen (CP-923) -> **Does not work** with Wacom One (Gen 1) (DTC-133) tablet

### Forwards compatibility

* Old pen (CP-913) -> Does work with new new Wacom One (Gen 2) tablets

### Samsung Galaxy S compatibility

* I confirmed both pens (CP-913, CP-923) work with the Samsung Galaxy S8 Ultra.
* I confirmed that the Samsung S Pen works with both the Wacom One (Gen 1) tablet and the Wacom One (Gen 2) tablets

### Serious Pressure problems

* The CP-923 pen has issues with low pressure. See this video: [https://youtu.be/415ngQOHiME](https://youtu.be/415ngQOHiME)
* The CP-913 does not have these issues
