## Using a Wacom Intuos 4 in 2023 or later

These are still excellent tablets. However, Wacom has dropped support for them in their latest drivers.

For example none of them are listed in the compatibility list for Wacom windows driver version 6.4.4-4:&#x20;

You can still use these tablets with caveats that come with using older tablets. More here:[ **using older drawing tablets**](../../../guides/general/using-older-drawing-tablets.md)
