# 7P notes: Wacom One Pen GEN1 (CP-913)

The Wacom One Pen (CP-913) was design to work with the Wacom One GEN/2019 (DTC-33) which was one of Wacom's consumer pen display.&#x20;

This pen is a very "consumer" pen, and it has a **OK performance** but is absolutely not as good as Wacom's Pro Pens such as the Wacom Pro Pen 2 (KP-504E).&#x20;

Two things separate this pen from Wacom's Pro Pens:

* IAF
* Buttons

## Pressure&#x20;

It has a higher IAF and thus requires more force to register a stroke. If you've used other Wacom Pens you may be very disappointed in this pen. If you've never used a drawing tablet before It may not be as big an issue.

* A Pro Pen 2 has an IAF of <1gf. Which is EXCELLENT
* Apple Pencil GEN2 has an IAF of <1gf. Which is EXCELLENT
* A typical non-Wacom pen has an IAF of 3g which is GOOD
* The CP-913 has an IAF of \~5gf which is OK.

Its max pressure is about \~350gf. This is good.

## Buttons

&#x20;Unlike the vast majority of drawing tablet pens which have 2 buttons, this only has a single button.



## Next Generation Wacom One GEN2 pen (CP-913)

This successor pen CP-923, is awful. See my notes: [7P notes: Wacom One Pen GEN2 (CP-923)](7p-notes-wacom-cp-923.md)&#x20;
