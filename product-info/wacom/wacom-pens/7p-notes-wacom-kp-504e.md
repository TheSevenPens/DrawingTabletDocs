# 7P notes: Pro Pen 2 (KP-504E)

## Overview

The Wacom Pro Pen 2 is an INCREDIBLE pen. Despite the existence of the Pro Pen 3, I think the Pro Pen 2 is better. This is the standard against which I judge all other pens.

## Pressure

* It supports 8192 levels of pressure
* Like other Wacom pro pens it has an very low IAF of <1gf.
* As of May 2024 it has the highest maximum pressure in the industry of almost 800gf.

## Features

* Two buttons
* Eraser&#x20;

## Cost

It is an expensive pen  at about $90. So it is more expensive than some pen tablets themselves.
