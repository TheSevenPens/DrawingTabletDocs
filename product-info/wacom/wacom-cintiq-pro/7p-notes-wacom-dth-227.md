# 7P notes: Wacom Cintiq Pro 22 (DTH-227)

## Summary

The Cintiq Pro 22 (DTH-227) along with the Cintiq Pro 27 (DTH-271) are the best pen displays in the market as of July 22.

This is my favorite tablet of the 70+ that I own. I prefer drawing on this one more than any other because of the drawing quality and the size (not too big, not too small).

## Anti-glare Sparkle

Rating: GOOD (LOW)&#x20;

It has a little more than the Cintiq Pro 27 - but that is to be expected since it has a higher PPI.

## Dead Pixels

I saw none when I started using it and none have developed.

I left it running in **Native** mode.

## Parallax

EXCELLENT - very little parallax.

## Pen tracking accuracy

* Wacom does not publish numbers
* I found it to be extremely accurate at the edged and corners
  * A bit more accurate than the Cintiq Pro 27 (DTH-271)

## Diagonal wobble

Rating: GOOD. Exhibits a slight wobble in diagonal lines.

Slightly better than Cintiq Pro 27.

## Pressure handling

EXCELLENT (best in the industry) because the pens are very good.

## Pointer lag

GOOD but not GREAT - this is typical for a pen display

Switching to 120Hz makes a little bit of difference to pointer lag but not much.

## Cabling and connections

### Using single USB-C cable

Unlike many other 16" pen displays, a single USB-C cable is not enough to power this tablet. You Still have to use their supplied power adapter.

## How I connect it to my PC

Instead of using Wacom's USB-C cable, I use a Cable Matters Thunderbolt 3 cable to connect it to the USB 4 port on my mini pc.

## Fans

It DOES have fans. Which cause some noise.

There is no control over the speed of the fans.

## Noise

* The fan noise is always on.
* Quieter than than the Cintiq Pro 27 (DTH-271) but louder than the Cintiq Pro 16 (DTH-167).
* At 50% brightness the noise the noise is audible but does not bother me unlike the DTH-271 which I am irritated by. With normal sounds in my office (Air conditioner, etc) I often can't pick up the sound.

## Heat

Fans keep it cool. At the default brightness, the tablet is cool to the touch - maybe just very slightly warm.

## Touch

Supports touch.

* There is a physical button on the back of the pen display to enable/disable touch.
* Most of the time I disable touch but occasionally use it when I need to.

## Express Keys

* total of 8
* 4 on back left
* 4 on back right
* I don't enjoy the express keys. I find them awkward to use. Instead I use a tourbox.

## Build quality

EXCELLENT

## OSD

* You can get to the OSD by pressing a physical button on the back of the tablet

## Stand

It does NOT come with a stand.

There is a specific Wacom Cintiq 22 Stand which is very expensive.

I instead use a much cheaper Huion ST100a stand.

## Legs

It does NOT have any legs

## Laying flat

The back of the the pen display has pieces that stick out due to the buttons. This means:

* It does not lay down flat on a desk
* It will slide around easily

## VESA mounting

It has 100mmx100mm VESA mounting holes on the back.&#x20;
