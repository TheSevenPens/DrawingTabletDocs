# 7P notes: Wacom Cintiq Pro 22 (DTH-227)

## <mark style="color:red;">THIS DOCUMENT IS IN PROGRESS</mark>

## Noise

Quieter than than the Cintiq Pro 27 (DTH-271) but louder than the Cintiq Pro 16 (DTH-167).

Noise is audible but does not bother me unlike the DTH-271.

## AG Sparkle

Rating: LOW to MODERATE

It has more than the Cintiq Pro 27 - but that is to be expected since it has a higher PPI.

## Using single USB-C cable

Unlike many other 16" pen displays, a single USB-C cable is not enough to power this tablet. You Still have to use their supplied power adapter.

## Temperature

Fans keep it cool. At the default brightness, the tablet is cool to the touch.

## Diagonal Wobble

TBD
