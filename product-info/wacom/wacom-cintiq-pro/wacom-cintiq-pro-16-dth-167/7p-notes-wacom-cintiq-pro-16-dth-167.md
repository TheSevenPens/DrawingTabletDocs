# 7P notes: Wacom Cintiq Pro 16 (DTH-167)

## Initial two day reaction

I genuinely like this tablet. The design and drawing experience is good.&#x20;

## Noise

While it does have a fan, the tablet isn't very loud at all, unlike the Cintiq Pro 27.

## Ports

It has 3 ports located on the top edge:

* HDMI
* USB-C (DP alt mode support)
* Power.&#x20;

I have it connected with a thunderbolt 3 cable and the power adapter that it came with.

## Temperature

Fans keep it cool. At the default brightness, the tablet is cool to the touch.

Testing now with maximum brightness.
