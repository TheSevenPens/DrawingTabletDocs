# 7P notes: Wacom One GEN1 (DTC-133)

### **Summary**

This solid tablet beginner tablet - though it is overpriced for what it is.

I still find 13" tablets a little too small for me. I normally recommend 16" tablets. But as a starter tablet or intended for use by a child, this size works well.

**NOTE: Wacom One GEN2 pen displays**

Wacom did release the Wacom One 13 touch GEN2 tablet which is the direct successor, but that tablet is more expansive and has worse pressure handling.

### **Connectivity**

The tablet comes with a 3-in-1 cable. Wacom calls this the "X-shape cable". And you must use this specific cable from Wacom.&#x20;

**NOTE: Cable attachment direction**

Also when you plug in the 3-in-1 cable to the top of the tablet, the cord from should go to the left. If the cord goes to the right the tablet won't work. See the diagrom below from Wacom's user manual for this tablet.

**Single USB-C connection**

The tablet DOES NOT work with a single USB-C cable.

### **Display Panel**

This has an AVHA display panel, not IPS. The colors are a little washed out and viewing angles are not great.

### **Pen**

The supplied Wacom One GEN1 pen (CP-913) is a decent pen. It's not as good as what you would find with the Pro Pen 2. It is comparable to the Samsung S pen in terms of IAF and pressure range.
