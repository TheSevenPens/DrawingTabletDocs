# 7P notes: One by Wacom (CTL-x72)

## Overview

The One By Wacom series of pen tablet (CTL-672, and CTL-472) are excellent beginner tablets.

## Models

* One by Wacom Medium (CTL-672) - released 2019
* One by Wacom Small (CTL-472) - released 2019

## **Core features**

* **Pen** - The tablet comes with a Wacom 2K Pen (LP-190K). This is a standard 2-button pen and has a very low IAF (which is good). My notes on this pen: [**7P notes: Wacom 2K Pen (LP-190K)**](../wacom-pen-models/7p-notes-wacom-2k-pen-lp-190k.md)  &#x20;
* **Pressure Levels** - 4096. This is enough pressure levels (all you need are about 2000 levels of pressure)&#x20;
* **Tilt** - this tablet does NOT support tilt
  * For a beginner this may not be an issue. Many people do not need tilt.&#x20;

## **Cabling and connectivity**

* Cable
* Wireless - These tablets **DO NOT SUPPORT WIRELESS CONNECTIVITY**. You must always use them with a cable.

## ExpressKeys

These tablets do NOT have any buttons or dials on the tablet.&#x20;

## **Feeling**

The One by Wacom pen is a little more plasticky and less premium feeling in hand than the Huion pen (and certainly less than Wacom's professional pens) but again I think this is not a big deal for a beginner.&#x20;
