# 7P notes: One by Wacom Medium (CTL-672)

The One By Wacom (CTL-672) is an excellent beginner tablet.

**Core features**

* The pen (Wacom 2K pen )
  * features a low minimum pressure (IAF) of <1gf. See [pen pressure](../../../guides/core-features/pen-pressure.md).&#x20;
  * maximum pressure is on average for non-professional pens&#x20;
  * had two buttons
* Tilt - this tablet does not support tilt
  * For a beginner this may not be an issue. Many people do not need tilt.&#x20;

**Feeling**

The One by Wacom pen is a little more plasticky and less premium feeling in hand than the Huion pen (and certainly less than Wacom's professional pens) but again I think this is not a big deal for a beginner.&#x20;
