# 7P notes: Wacom One GEN1 (DTC-133)

**Summary**

This solid tablet beginner tablet - though it is overpriced for what it is.

I still think 13" tablets are too small for adults. I normally recommend 16" tablets. but as a starter tablet, and for a child, this is OK.

Wacom did release the Wacom One 13 touch GEN2 tablet which is the direct successor, but that tablet is more expansive and was worse pressure handling.

**Connectivity**

The tablet comes with a 3-in-1 cable. And you must use this specific cable.

Also that what you plug in the 3-in-1 cable to the top of the tablet, the cord from should go to the left. If the cord goes to the right the tablet won't work.

The tablet DOES NOT work with a single USB-C cable.

**Display Panel**

This has an AVHA display panel, not IPS. The colors are a little washed out and viewing angles are not great.

**Pen**

The supplied Wacom One GEN1 pen (CP-913) is a decent pen.

* 4096 pressure levels
* Two buttons
