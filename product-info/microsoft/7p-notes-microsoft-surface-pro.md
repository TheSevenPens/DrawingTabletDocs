# 7P notes: Microsoft Surface Pro

If you are looking for running desktop apps, then the **Surface Pro 8** (and above) is a good choice when combined with Surface Pro Signature Keyboard and Slim Pen 2.&#x20;

Surface Pro 7 ands below do not have good pens for drawing. They exhibit too much line wobble.

I find the drawing experience to be OK / Tolerable with the Surface Pro. It doesn't match what you get from the iPad or the Samsung Galaxy Tab series.
