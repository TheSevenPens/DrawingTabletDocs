# 7P notes: Microsoft Surface Pro

## Overview

If you are looking for running Windows desktop apps on a standalone tablet, then the **Surface Pro 8** (and above) is a good choice when combined with Surface Pro Signature Keyboard and Slim Pen 2.&#x20;

<mark style="color:red;">**IMPORTANT: As of June 2024, DO NOT get a Surface Pro that uses an ARM processor (example: Microsoft Surface Pro 11).**</mark> They do not work with drawing tablets at the moment. More here: [Windows on ARM](../../guides/windows/windows-on-arm.md).

## Drawing experience

Surface Pro 7 ands below do not have good pens for drawing. They exhibit too much line wobble.

I find the drawing experience to be OK / Tolerable with the Surface Pro 8 and above. It doesn't match what you get from the iPad or the Samsung Galaxy Tab series.

I really don't find these devices are more suited to note taking rather than drawing (though you can certainly use them for that)
