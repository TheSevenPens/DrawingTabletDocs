# Samsung Galaxy Tab A

## Overview

I DO NOT RECOMMEND purchasing the Galaxy Tab A series tablet if you want to do digital art. The key issue is that The A9 series DOES NOT SUPPORT an EMR pen. This series only supports capacitive pens which are very bad for digital art.

## Alternatives

Look at the Galaxy Tab S series which works with the Samsung S pen - which is a decent EMR pen. If you are looking to save money check out the Samsung Galaxy Tab S6 lite.
