# 7P notes: Samsung Galaxy Tab S

The Samsung Galaxy Tabs S series of tablets with the and the Samsung S Pen can play the role of drawing tablets very well and are a compelling alternative to Apple iPads.

The tablets I own:

* Samsung Galaxy Tab S8 Ultra <- RECOMMENDED.
* Samsung Galaxy Tab S9 FE <- HIGHLY RECOMMENDED. Great value at reasonable cost.
* Samsung Galaxy Tab S6 LITE (2022 edition) <- RECOMMENDED as great budget choice for esp. for beginners

## Size

The Samsung Galaxy Tab series has many models that span a wide range of sizes.

Size has a huge impact on how the tablet feels to use especially with the 16X9 aspect ratio of these tablets. So put careful thought into picking the appropriate size for you.

* The size of the S9 FE is compact which makes it portable but big enough for me to draw on the couch and in bed and when I am travelling.  &#x20;
* The S8 Ultra is very big. This works great when using it like a laptop, but it's size with its 16x9 aspect ratio can a bit just too much to deal with when holding close to drawing.

## Pointer lag

RATING: Very good

All three exhibit very low pointer lag. A bit more than the apply pencil, but less than even high end pen displays such as a Wacom Cintiq Pro.

## Pens

The Galaxy Tab models come with an Samsung S Pen but they are also compatible with a few other pens. In particular the Wacom One GEN1 pen (CP-913).

### Using the Samsung S Pen

RATING: GOOD. The S Pen uses standard Wacom EMR and delivers a consistent drawing experience to what you would find in drawing tablets. I prefer it to the Apple pencil though it is not as good as the Wacom Pro Pen 2 in terms of pressure range.

The overall pressure of the S pen is good. In my testing it has a good maximum pressure of about 250gf. The IAF - I am not sure - I think it could be around 3gf.

### Using the Wacom One GEN1 Pen CP-913

RATING: VERY GOOD.  The Wacom CP-913 pen provides an better experience with this device. When I draw with a Samsung S series tablet  I usually use the CP-913 that came with my Wacom One (DTC-133).

## Pen Buttons

The S Pen has one physical button, unlike the Apple iPad. This also differs from the pens of most drawing tablets like the Wacom Intuos or Wacom Intuos Pro. Those pens have two buttons, and some have three. More here: [**Samsung S Pen**](samsung-s-pen.md)

## System lag

The S8 and S9 are incredibly responsive and I don't notice much lag. They seemed as responsive as an iPad.

The S6 LITE is a little laggy when scrolling and using apps, but for basic line art with the Infinite Painter app I felt it was responsive.&#x20;

## Apps

As for software here are the apps I use with it. Stars indicate the my favorite apps.

* Clip Studio Paint ⭐
* Infinite Painter (works similar to Procreate on iPads) ⭐
* Krita
* IbisPaint X

A common question from people considering the Samsung Galaxy tab series is whether the procreate app works on these tablets. The answer is no. Procreate only works on iPads.

## Using the tablet as an external monitor via USB-C

This means sending a display signal from a computer to this tablet.

This tablet has no built in way to act as a monitor for your PC via USB-C.

Some people report that they can use software called [SuperDisplay](https://superdisplay.app/) to make this happen, but I have not tried it.&#x20;

## Using an external monitor via USB

This means sending a display signal from the tablet to an external monitor.

This is not supported and does not work.
