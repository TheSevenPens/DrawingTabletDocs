# 7P notes: Samsung Galaxy Tab

The Samsung Galaxy Tabs S series of tablets with the and the Samsung S Pen can play the role of drawing tablets very well and are a compelling alternative to Apple iPads.

The tablets I own:

* Samsung Galaxy Tab S8 Ultra <- RECOMMENDED
* Samsung Galaxy Tab S9 FE <- HIGHLY RECOMMENDED. Great value at reasonable cost.
* Samsung Galaxy Tab S6 LITE <- great budget choice for beginners

## Size

* Honestly the S8 Ultra is very big. This works great when using it like a laptop, but it's size with its 16x9 aspect ratio can a bit just too much to deal with when holding close to drawing.
* The size of the S9 FE is compact which makes it portable but big enough for me to draw on the couch and in bed and when I am travelling.  &#x20;

## Pointer lag

RATING: Very good

All three exhibit very low pointer lag. A bit more than the apply pencil, but less than even high end pen displays such as a Wacom Cintiq Pro.

## Drawing feeling

RATING: Very good

The S Pen uses standard Wacom EMR and delivers a consistent drawing experience to what you would find in drawing tablets. I prefer it to the Apple pencil though it is not as good as the Wacom Pro Pen 2 in terms of pressure range.

## Pen Buttons

The S Pen has a physical button, unlike the Apple iPad.

## System lag

The S8 and S9 are incredibly responsive and I don't notice any lag.

The S6 LITE is a little laggy when scrolling and using apps, but for basic line art with the Infinite Painter app I felt it was responsive.&#x20;
