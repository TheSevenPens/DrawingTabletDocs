# 7P notes: Samsung S Pen

## Note

There are several different Samsung S Pens. I am referring to the S Pens that come with the Samsung Galaxy Tab series.

### Overall

RATING: GOOD. The S Pen uses standard Wacom EMR and delivers a consistent drawing experience to what you would find in drawing tablets. I prefer it to the Apple pencil though it is not as good as the Wacom Pro Pen 2 in terms of pressure range.

## Pressure

The overall pressure of the S pen is good.&#x20;

**maximum pressure**

In my testing it has a good maximum pressure of about 250gf.

**Initial activation force**

It's supposed to be around 3gf.

I have not independently verified this.

## Buttons

The S Pen has one physical button, unlike the Apple iPad. This also differs from the pens of most drawing tablets like the Wacom Intuos or Wacom Intuos Pro. Those pens have two buttons, and some have three.&#x20;
