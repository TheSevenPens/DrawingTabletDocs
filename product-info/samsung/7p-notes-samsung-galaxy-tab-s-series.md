# 7P notes: Samsung Galaxy Tab S series

The Samsung Galaxy Tabs S series of tablets with the and the Samsung S Pen can play the role of drawing tablets very well and are a compelling alternative to Apple iPads.

The tablets I own:

* Samsung Galaxy Tab S8 Ultra <- RECOMMENDED. ([**my notes on this tablet**](7p-notes-samsung-s8-ultra.md))
* Samsung Galaxy Tab S9 FE <- HIGHLY RECOMMENDED. Great value at reasonable cost.
* Samsung Galaxy Tab S6 LITE (2022 edition or 2024 edition) <- RECOMMENDED as great budget choice for esp. for beginners.

## Size

The Samsung Galaxy Tab series has many models that span a wide range of sizes.

Size has a huge impact on how the tablet feels to use especially with the 16X9 aspect ratio of these tablets. So put careful thought into picking the appropriate size for you.

* The size of the S9 FE is compact which makes it portable but big enough for me to draw on the couch and in bed and when I am travelling.  &#x20;
* The S8 Ultra is very big. This works great when using it like a laptop, but it's size with its 16x9 aspect ratio can a bit just too much to deal with when holding close to drawing.

## Pens

### Standard pens

The Galaxy Tab models come with an Samsung S Pen. Here are my notes: [**7P notes: Samsung S Pen**](samsung-s-pen/7p-notes-samsung-s-pen.md).

### Compatible Pens

These tablets. they are also compatible with a few other pens.&#x20;

### Using the Wacom One GEN1 Pen CP-913

The Wacom CP-913 pen provides an better experience with this device. When I draw with a Samsung S series tablet  Some people (including myself) use the CP-913 that came with my Wacom One (DTC-133) with Samsung Tablets.

### Using the Wacom One GEN2 Pen CP-923

This pen is trash. Avoid it. My notes: [7P notes: Wacom One Pen GEN2 (CP-923)](../wacom/wacom-pens/7p-notes-wacom-cp-923.md)&#x20;

## Pointer lag

RATING: Very good

All three exhibit very low pointer lag. A bit more than the apply pencil, but less than even high end pen displays such as a Wacom Cintiq Pro.

## System lag

* The S8 and S9 are incredibly responsive and I don't notice much lag. They seemed almost as responsive as an iPad.
* The S6 LITE is a little laggy when scrolling and using apps, but for basic line art with the Infinite Painter app I felt it was responsive.&#x20;

## Apps

As for software here are the apps I use with it. Stars indicate the my favorite apps.

* Clip Studio Paint ⭐
* Infinite Painter (works similar to Procreate on iPads) ⭐
* Krita
* IbisPaint X

A common question from people considering the Samsung Galaxy tab series is whether the procreate app works on these tablets. The answer is no. Procreate only works on iPads.

## Using a Galaxy Tab S tablet as an external monitor via USB-C

This means sending a display signal from a computer to this tablet. These tablets have no built in way to act as a monitor for your PC via USB-C.

Some people report that they can use software called [SuperDisplay](https://superdisplay.app/) to make this happen, but I have not tried it.&#x20;

## Using an external monitor via USB

This means sending a display signal from the tablet to an external monitor. Whether this works depends on the model involved. My understanding is that only the Galaxy Tab S Ultra series can do this.

In my testing

* Samsung Galaxy Tab S8 Ultra- can use an external monitor
* Samsung Galaxy Tab S9 FE - can not use an external monitor
* Samsung Galaxy Tab S6 LITE - can not use an external monitor
