# 7P notes: Samsung S8 Ultra

## Device size

* Size: 326.4 x 208.6 x 5.5 mm (12.85 x 8.21 x 0.22 in)
* Due to its aspect ratio and size it is very awkward to hold in a hand unlike an iPad.&#x20;
* This is a tablet that works best sitting on a desk

## Display

* Size: 12.38 X 7.74" (313.67 X 196.05mm)
* Aspect Ratio: 16:10
* Diagonal size: 14.6" (369.9mm)
* Resolution: 1848 x 2960 pixels,
* Looks great. Really nothing bad to say about it at all.&#x20;
* It's crisp and bright.

## Performance

* While I didn't stress it, I found it the performance to be good. I had no complaints.
* Scrolling seemed snappy at all times and without any stuttering.

## Battery life

Very good compared to a laptop. not as good compared to an iPad.

Also I noticed that when I was not using the device it seemed to quickly run down the battery after a few days. Unlike an iPad which seems to preserve its battery well when it is not in use.

## Pen

The tablet comes with a Samsung S Pen. [<mark style="background-color:green;">**My notes on the Samsung S Pen**</mark>](samsung-s-pen/7p-notes-samsung-s-pen.md)

## Galaxy Tab S8 Ultra Book Cover Keyboard

* The cover keyboard is two pieces
  * One piece attaches to the back of the S8 Ultra
  * One piece is the keyboard
  * The two pieces magnetically attach
* Typing experience is OK
* The cover is strongly attached to the back of the Tab S8 Ultra. it's not easy to dislodge.&#x20;
* The strength of the attachment between the two pieces is very weak
  * it is very easy to dislodge the connection accidentally
  * Absolutely Do NOT lift the device by the keyboard part only. Even if it stays connected initially it will detach from the part of the cover that is attached to the tablet.
