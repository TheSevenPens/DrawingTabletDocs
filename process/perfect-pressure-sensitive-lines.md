# Perfect pressure sensitive lines

It's not possible for a human to push down on the tib of the pen with a perfect monotonically changing amount of pressure.

To do this I use a Kuuube's pressure emulation plugin for OpenTabletDriver.

You can download the plugin from here: [https://github.com/Kuuuube/Pressure\_Emulation](https://github.com/Kuuuube/Pressure\_Emulation)&#x20;

This is my standard configuration

Pressure Resolution - to simulate N levels of pressure. Shown below is 256. Setting it to zero will not affect the pressure values

Line length - 800

Line X Offset - 200
