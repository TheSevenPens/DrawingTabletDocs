These are my notes on the things to look at when I evaluate a tablet. This is a work in progress and evolves over time.&#x20;

## Summary&#x20;

These are the quick summary highlights. &#x20;

* Model number
* Active Area - dimensions and diagonal size&#x20;
* Release year
* Key interesting points
* Links
  * Any manufacturer videos
  * Product page
  * User manual

## Display > basics&#x20;

* Display size - should be same as active area
* Display resolution
* Aspect ratio
* Response time
* Max refresh rate
* Brightness
  * Future: see if this can be independently measured
* Contrast ratio
* Display panel tech: IPS, OLED, etc.
* Bit depth
  * If >8pp clarify if it is using FRC or not

* Measure Max Pressure
* Pressure transition at low pressure
  * Look for instability / pulsing

## Pen tracking accuracy

* Accuracy in middle versus corner and edges
* Tilt compensation

## Diagonal Wobble

* see: [Measuring diagonal wobble](measuring-diagonal-wobble.md)

## Pointer lag

* How does it compare to other tablets?&#x20;

## Pen Tilt

* Does tilt work correctly at edges and corners?

## Pen Hover Height

* See: [Measuring hover height](measuring-hover-height.md)

## Display > Color modes

* List color modes
* Identify which color modes the testing was done under

## Display > other

* Dead pixels - did you notice any?
* Backlight bleed - take photo in a darkened room
* Display sharpness
  * Are the pixels clear when viewed close up?&#x20;
  * How blurry is it compared to other pen displays?

Fan Noise

* What is the noise experience at 50% brightness?
* What is the noise experience at 100% brightness?

Touch

* Is touch supported? On Windows? On MacOS?

## Other

Sound support
