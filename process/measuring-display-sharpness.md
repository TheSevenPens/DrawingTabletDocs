# Measuring display sharpness

Overview

Pen displays have some anti-glare treatment that introduces a small amount of blur. It can vary widely between pen displays.

I've created a simple test image to so I can consistently evaluate the blur.

It's a small PNG file with black and white pixels.

The process is to simply take a photo of what this image looks like at 100% magnification. This means every pixel in the image corresponds to exactly 1 pixel on the display.
