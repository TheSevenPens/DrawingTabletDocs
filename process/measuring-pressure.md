# Measuring pressure



## Scale

I use this scale. It is delicate enough to measure 0.1g which makes it good for IAF testing and can support 5kg of weight which is good for handling the weight of the tablet.

This model also features a way to get its data to a computer, but I haven't tried that yet.
