# Measuring pressure



## Scale

I use this scale. It is delicate enough to measure 0.1g which makes it good for IAF testing and can support 5kg of weight which is good for handling the weight of the tablet.

### &#x20;Programmatically getting the pressure data to a PC

Tablet expert Kuuube, has provided some sample code to read the data from the scale into a PC using Python. See the github project here: [https://github.com/Kuuuube/Misc\_Scripts/tree/main/scripts\_and\_programs/us\_solid\_scale\_reade](https://github.com/Kuuuube/Misc\_Scripts/tree/main/scripts\_and\_programs/us\_solid\_scale\_reade)&#x20;
