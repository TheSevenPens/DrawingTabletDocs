# Pressure range data

I am actively collecting pressure range data.

All the data is stored here: [https://1drv.ms/x/s!Aml8i4Jd6crCkTerfXD\_1zsIxg3A?e=7HqT7T](https://1drv.ms/x/s!Aml8i4Jd6crCkTerfXD\_1zsIxg3A?e=7HqT7T)&#x20;

Key notes:

* I am not good at measuring IAF, so I believe my measurements show higher IAF than is accurate
* I am confident in my max pressure measurments
* I assign inventory IDs to my pens so that I can track them over time
* Remember a given model of pen has individual units that can have widely vartying IAF and MAX pressure values.
