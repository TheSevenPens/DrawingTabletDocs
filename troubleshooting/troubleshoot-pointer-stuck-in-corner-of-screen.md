# Troubleshoot pointer stuck in corner of screen

Overview

Normally the pointer should follow the movement of the pen. However sometimes it gets stuck in the corner of the screen. Usually I have seen this in the upper-left-hand corner but it could happen elsewhere.

It's unclear what causes this problem.&#x20;

## Basic things to try

Sometimes this clears up the problem.

* Restarting the computer
* Testing with another computer.
* Reinstalling the driver
* Installing the latest version of the driver.

## Other things to try

* Temporarily change the active area to only a portion of its default size. Then change to back to use the a larger area on the tablet.&#x20;
  * 7P: This worked for me once
* Change the resolution of your screen to a smaller resolution then back to the original resolution.
* If you are using more than one monitor, switch between extend and duplicate modes for the desktop.
* If you are using Microsoft Windows,  then [**test with Windows PNP tablet drivers**](testing-with-windows-pnp-drawing-tablet-drivers.md) to see if the problem happens in that case.
* If you have a pen display, it likely has a calibration feature. Start the and complete the calibration process to see if that addresses the issue.&#x20;
