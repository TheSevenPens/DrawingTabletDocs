# Troubleshoot random gaps in strokes

This manifests as gaps in strokes.

The gaps will not be aligned vertically or horizontally - which is a sign of a different problem.&#x20;

## Overview

I've been unable to identify a clear origin for this problem, but I suspect either:

* Something is wrong with the pen
* Possibly electromagnetic interference from some other device

## Things to try&#x20;

* First try the [**Common drawing troubleshooting steps**](common-drawing-troubleshooting-steps.md).&#x20;
* Check if this is associated with a specific pressure range.
  * In the driver try increasing the lower bound of the pressure range and see how the gaps react.
    * Do they develop earlier in the stroke?
    * Do the stop developing?
* If it continues to happen, then [**contact support**](../basics/contacting-support.md).
