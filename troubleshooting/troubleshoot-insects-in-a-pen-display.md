## Insect invasion

Usually people might find 1 bug in their display. In some rare cases. there may be more. See the example below from a [**reddit thread**](https://www.reddit.com/r/wacom/comments/12nnhdc/ants\_in\_my\_wacom\_fml/).&#x20;

The original poster mentioned in the comments he did have some success: "Iâ€™ve managed to get most of them out by shaking the absolute sh\*t out of it and using a can of compressed air and bug spray."
