# Troubleshoot no pressure while drawing



Usually this problem seems to be a problem with the pen, but can also be a problem with the driver, and sometimes can be the tablet itself.

Try the [Common drawing troubleshooting steps](https://app.gitbook.com/o/-LBUpLETf4LFiwdypBiE/s/Nde0PQIvNcFZNVxuTO0G/\~/changes/1916/troubleshooting/common-drawing-troubleshooting-steps) these should resolve things most of the time. If that doesn't work, contact support.

Some other things to try

* Reset the pressure curve in the tablet driver
* Reset the pressure curve in your app
* If you recently swapped nibs, see if going back to the old nib fixes the problem
