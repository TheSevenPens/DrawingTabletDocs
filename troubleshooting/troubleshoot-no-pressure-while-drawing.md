# Troubleshoot no pressure while drawing



Usually this problem seems to be a problem with the pen, but can also be a problem with the driver, and sometimes can be the tablet itself.

Try the [**Common drawing troubleshooting steps**](https://app.gitbook.com/o/-LBUpLETf4LFiwdypBiE/s/Nde0PQIvNcFZNVxuTO0G/\~/changes/1916/troubleshooting/common-drawing-troubleshooting-steps) these should resolve things most of the time. If that doesn't work, contact support.

Some things to check

* Does the pressure work in the tablet driver pressure test region?
* What happens with the Krita tablet tester?
  * Krita > Settings > Configure Krita > Tablet settings > Open Tablet Tester
* See what happens with Windows PNP drivers instead of the manufacturer drivers: [Testing with Windows PNP drawing tablet drivers](testing-with-windows-pnp-drawing-tablet-drivers.md)

Some other things to try

* Reset the pressure curve in the tablet driver
* Reset the pressure curve in your app
* Reset the pressure curve in the brush in the app you are using
*
* If you recently swapped nibs, see if going back to the old nib fixes the problem
