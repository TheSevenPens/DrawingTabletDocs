# Troubleshoot no pressure while drawing



Usually this problem seems to be a problem with the pen, but can also be a problem with the driver, and sometimes can be the tablet itself.

Try the [**Common drawing troubleshooting steps**](https://app.gitbook.com/o/-LBUpLETf4LFiwdypBiE/s/Nde0PQIvNcFZNVxuTO0G/\~/changes/1916/troubleshooting/common-drawing-troubleshooting-steps) these should resolve things most of the time. If that doesn't work, contact support.

Some other things to try

* Reset the pressure curve in the tablet driver
* Reset the pressure curve in your app
* Reset the pressure curve in the brush in rthe app you are using
* [Testing with Windows PNP drawing tablet drivers](testing-with-windows-pnp-drawing-tablet-drivers.md)
* If you recently swapped nibs, see if going back to the old nib fixes the problem
