# Troubleshoot tablet not detected by tablet driver

## Overview

The "tablet not connected" problem is fundamentally that your computer cannot "see" the device even though it is plugged in via USB cable.

**IMPORTANT**: If pen display and see a "NO SIGNAL" message, go here: [**Troubleshoot No Signal**](troubleshoot-no-signal.md).

## Basic troubleshooting&#x20;

* Restart the computer. This sometimes resolves the problem.
* Unplug and re-plug the USB cable
* Try a different USB port.
* Try a different USB cable - make sure the USB cable supports data and not just power.
* Look at the USB ports and ends of the USB cables and verify they are clean. Remove any lint, etc. that you find.
* Uninstall and reinstall the driver.
* If you are using a pen display, verify it is getting enough power.
* On Windows, try uninstalling the driver, restarting the computer, then plug in the tablet and check if the pen moved the pointer and clicks. If this works it may indicate that the tablet driver has a problem.
* Try the tablet with another computer.
  * If it doesn't work there, then that suggest the tablet itself is having problems.
  * If it does work there, then retry with your own computer.&#x20;

## Still not solved?

If none of these suggestions are helping, then [**contact support**](../guides/general/contacting-support.md).

## Notes

* When you plug in the tablet or unplug the tablet, check if the computer makes a "beep". This at least indicates that the computer is aware that there is some device there.
* Sometimes this problem is sporadic. I've had it personally occur with a tablet and after about 30 minutes of restarts, things just started working again.
* Some vendors like Huion recommend disabling antivirus when reinstalling the drivers. I do not recommend this, but some people say it has helped.
