# Check if the pen display works with another display output device

## Overview

If you are having problems with you're pen display when it is attached to your computer such as:

* Not seeing anything
* Odd Flickering
* Weird colors
* "no signal"

Then one way of identifying where the problem is try connecting your pen display to another device that provides a display signal. Here are some examples of devices you might already have:

* Another computer
* A gaming console like XBOX or PlayStation
* A DVD player
* Mirrorless cameras

If you can get a steady working image from another device, then it helps exclude the tablet itself as the source of the problem.
