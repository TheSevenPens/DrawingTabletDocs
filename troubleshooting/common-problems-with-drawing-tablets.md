# Common problems with drawing tablets

Typically here's what people encounter:

* They lose or damage their pen. Replacement pens are **expensive** - it may cost a significant portion of what you paid for the tablet.
* The pen no longer reports pressure&#x20;
* The pen pressure is stuck at 100%.
* The tablet driver cannot detect the tablet.
* The tablet driver cannot detect the pen.
* The pen display doesn't show anything.
* The pen display shows a NO SIGNAL message&#x20;

I have put together a list of troubleshooting articles to help with these problems and many others. More here [**troubleshooting**](./)&#x20;
