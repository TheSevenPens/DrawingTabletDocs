# Troubleshoot not enough HDMI ports

Many pen displays need to connect via HDMI to your computer.

You may be in a situation where you don't have any HDMI ports or don't have enough.

There are a couple of options you can look into:

* Use HDMI adapters to convert existing ports to HDMI. More here: [**Using HDMI adapters with pen displays**](../guides/pen-displays/using-hdmi-adapters-with-pen-displays/).
* Remember that HDMI splitters may not help. More here: [**Using HDMI splitters with pen displays**](../guides/pen-displays/using-hdmi-splitters-with-pen-displays.md)
* If your tablet supports getting a display signal via a USB-C cable, you MIGHT be able to use that as an alternative. See: [USB-C DisplayPort alt mode](../guides/pen-displays/usb-c-displayport-alt-mode.md)&#x20;
