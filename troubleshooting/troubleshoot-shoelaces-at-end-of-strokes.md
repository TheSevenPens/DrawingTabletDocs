# Troubleshoot shoelaces at end of strokes

## Overview

This is a common effect that is highly dependent on how you draw and the specific brush in your drawing app.

It manifests as a longer "string" at the end of your stroke. These ends can be rendered as a constant width or a long very thin string.

## Things to try

* Are you "flicking" the pen away from the tablet at the end of your strokes? This can induce the effect. Try not taking the pen off the tablet surface and ending the line slowly.
* Check if the effect happens with a different brush.
* You may need to reach out to other users of your application to see how they addressed it.
