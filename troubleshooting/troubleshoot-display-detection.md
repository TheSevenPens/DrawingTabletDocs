# Troubleshoot display detection

To use your pen display, your computer must be able to detect the display panel inside it.

Most of the time, when you plug in your tablet to your comptuer this will work automatically.

Unfortunately, sometimes your computer can sometimes have difficulty.

## Using NVIDIA Rigorous Display Detection

If your computer is not even detecting the existence of the display, and it has an NVIDIA GPU, the NVIDIA Control Panel have a feature called **Rigorous Display Detection** which help.

* Open the **NVIDIA Control Panel**
* Navigate to **Display > Set up multiple displays >  Select the displays you want to use**&#x20;
* Click on **My display is not shown**&#x20;
* This will launch the **Detect Missing Display** dialog
* Click **Rigorous Display Detection**

## Use Intel Graphics Command Center to detect your display

If your computer is a laptop or similar device that has an embedded Intel GPU, on Windows you can use the Intel Graphics Commend Center app to potentially detect additional displays.
