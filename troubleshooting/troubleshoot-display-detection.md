# Troubleshoot computer does not detect display

## Overview

* To use your pen display, your computer must be able to detect the display panel inside it.
* Most of the time, when you plug in your tablet to your computer this will work automatically.
* Unfortunately, sometimes your computer can sometimes have difficulty.

## Basic things to try or investigate

* Restart the computer - sometimes that can trigger the detection.
* Check the ports to make sure the cables are plugged in all the way
* Check the ports to ensure that there isn't some lint or other material preventing a secure connection.
* Use a different port. Suppose you are using an HDMI port, there may be multiple HDMI ports on your computer. Try the other ones.
* Use a different port type. For example, if you are using HDMI, try DisplayPort instead.
* See if the display can be detected by another computer or even any device that can send a display signal such as a DVD player or an XBOX.&#x20;

## Windows > built-in display detection
