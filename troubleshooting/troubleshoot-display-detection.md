# Troubleshoot computer does not detect display

## Overview

* To use your pen display, your computer must be able to detect the display panel inside it.
* Most of the time, when you plug in your tablet to your computer this will work automatically.
* Unfortunately, sometimes your computer can sometimes have difficulty.

## Basic things to try or investigate

* Restart the computer - sometimes that can trigger the detection.
* Check the ports to make sure the cables are plugged in all the way. This is a very common mistake.

## Ensure the ports are clear of obstruction

Check the ports to ensure that there isn't some lint or other material preventing a secure connection.

## Windows > built-in display detection

&#x20;In Display Settings, there is an option to detect a display. Try it.

## Use Intel Graphics Command Center to detect your display

If your computer is a laptop or similar device that has an embedded Intel GPU, on Windows you can use the Intel Graphics Commend Center app to potentially detect additional displays.

You can download the Intel Graphics Comment Center from the Microsoft Store.

## Use a another port of the same type

Suppose you are using an HDMI port, there may be multiple HDMI ports on your computer. Try the other ones.

## Use a another port of a different type

For example, if you are using HDMI, try DisplayPort instead.

## Check if the pen display can get a signal from another device

See if the display can be detected by another computer or even any device that can send a display signal such as a DVD player or an XBOX.&#x20;

If this works it tells you the pen display and cables work correctly and the problem has something to do with your computer.

## Depowering the device

Some people suggest doing this:

* UNPLUG the pen display from POWER
* hold the power button down&#x20;
* while continuing to hold the power button down, attach the pen display to power, and continue holding down the power for a few seconds.

## Firmware updates

Check with your manufacturer if there are any firmware updates.
