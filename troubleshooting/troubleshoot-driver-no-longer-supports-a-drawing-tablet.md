# Troubleshoot driver no longer supports a drawing tablet

* You could try an older version of your manufacturer's drivers that does support your tablet.
* You can try **OpenTabletDriver** ([https://opentabletdriver.net/](https://opentabletdriver.net/)). Setting up OpenTabletDriver on Windows can be challenging. I wrote this guide to provide step-by-step instructions: Try [**Using OpenTabletDriver with Windows**](../guides/drivers/opentabletdriver/opentabletdriver-windows.md). OpenTabletDriver has full support for tilt and pressure on Windows but not an MacOS.
