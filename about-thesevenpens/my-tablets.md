# My tablets

## Overview

I have a lot of tablets. All of these tablets are **personal purchases**.&#x20;

* None of the tablets were provided by a manufacturer or gifted to me.
* Many tablets were purchased used from eBay
* I use [**OpenTabletDriver**](../guides/drivers/opentabletdriver/) instead of the manufacturer driver for older tablets.
