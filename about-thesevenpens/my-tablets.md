# My drawing tablets

* All of these tablets are **personal purchases**. None of the tablets were provided by a manufacturer or gifted to me.
* Many of these tablets were bought used: [**Buying used drawing tablets**](../buying-a-drawing-tablet/buying-used-drawing-tablets.md)&#x20;
* Some of these tablets are quite old - 10 years, 20+ years. Even though they work perfectly their age does make it more complex to use them. More here: [**Using older drawing tablets**](../guides/general/using-older-drawing-tablets.md)&#x20;
