# My drawing tablets

* To see a full list of my tablets: [https://1drv.ms/x/s!Aml8i4Jd6crCginxzCU7kvh4NB4w?e=Mkq7sx](https://1drv.ms/x/s!Aml8i4Jd6crCginxzCU7kvh4NB4w?e=Mkq7sx)&#x20;
* In that list you can see
  * The tablet name, model number, and brand
  * When I purchased the tablet
  * Which store I purchased from
  * The year the tablet model was released
  * Whether the tablet was bought new or used&#x20;
* Some of these tablets are quite old - 10 years, 20+ years. Even though they work perfectly their age does make it more complex to use them. More here: [**Using older drawing tablets**](../guides/general/using-older-drawing-tablets.md)&#x20;
