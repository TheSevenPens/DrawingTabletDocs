# Welcome

I like drawing tablets and have used drawing tablets for a long time. On this site, I collected all my notes about drawing tablets them over the years.

The most popular topics here:&#x20;

* [**Beginner's guide to drawing tablets**](guides/beginners-guide.md) - If you are not really sure what a drawing tablet is, this is a great place to start.
* [**Buying a drawing tablet**](buying-a-drawing-tablet/) - For those of you trying to buy a drawing tablet, this is a comprehensive set of notes about the things you should consider when looking at one.
* [**Recommendations**](recommendations/) - Because I've used so many tablets, I have recommendations about which ones I think will work well.&#x20;
* There are many [**troubleshooting guides**](troubleshooting/).
* If you just got your drawing tablet and want to know how to set it up and start drawing, check out [**Get started with a drawing tablet**](guides/get-started-with-a-drawing-tablet.md).
