## Full list of apps

I've collected a list of apps here: [**List of apps**](list-of-apps.md)  &#x20;

* They are organized by category (painting, note-taking, etc.)
* Free apps are highlighted
* For each app, the platform is identified (MacOS, Windows, Android, iOS, etc.)

## Applications that come with a drawing tablet

Most drawing tablets come with a limited-time trial license to some applications. Usually these trials last anywhere from 3 to 6 months. After this time, you'll have to pay for the app. Some are subscription and some are one-time-purchases.

## All apps work with drawing tablet pens

How an app works with a drawin tablet pen, depends on wether the app is "pen-aware".

* **pen-aware apps** - these apps know about pens, pressure, tilt, etc. and can take advantage of those features
* **other apps** - these apps don't know about pens. So when you use a pen with them, the application treats them just like a mouse. In fact the app has no idea you are using a pen. The pen will work for basic tasks. For example the pen can move the operating system pointer, you can press down with the pen to draw or click, the buttons may work. However, the app won't do anything special with pen capabilities like tilt, or pressure sensitivity.
