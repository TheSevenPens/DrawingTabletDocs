# 7P notes: Recommended apps

## Overview

Keep in mind that I use my drawing tablets in very specific ways. And I certainly don't use every kind of application. But if you are curious below you can find the apps that I recommend and why I recommend them.

If you want to see a full list of applications go here: [applications](./)

## Clip Studio Paint

[**Clip Studio Paint**](clip-studio-paint.md) - Medium Cost, Advanced, very powerful, multiplatform.&#x20;

For me doing illustration that is mostly line art, nothing beats Clip Studio Paint.

There is just so much sophistication in this app. I really think the people who make it truly understand the work that goes into making an illustration at a very deep level.

And it shows up in for example all the very interesting options they have for filling an area with the color, or how they incorporate vector based reference layers.

I don't think there's any other program out there that is as productive for doing line art - for example things like comics or manga - as clip studio paint.

Although clip studio paint is not free, it does not cost that much either. I subscribe to a plan where I pay about $52 a year. And that lets me run clip studio paint on four separate devices

## Krita

[**Krita**](krita.md) - FREE, Advanced, multiplatform. Very powerful.&#x20;

Obviously being free is a great benefit of using this application. But more importantly it's actually an amazing drawing program. I use Krita when I want to do a more traditional painting style. So don't use it for line art or illustrations. But whenever I feel like I want to do a lot of work with colors or that needs a lot of sophisticated brushes then I use Krita.

Because Krita is free and open source it is also the app I use when I am testing tablets. For example when I am trying to determine how good a tablet or pen works with pressure I'm always testing that with Krita.

It is a more complicated application, so I'm not sure it would be the best for a beginner.

## Affinity Photo

**Affinity Photo** - for basic photo editing

For basic photo editing I use affinity photo. So for example basic color correction, or cropping, etcetera.

One of the great things about affinity photo is that it is a one time purchase. And as of yet there is no subscription plan. I know for some of you that will be very important.

## Adobe Photoshop

[Adobe Photoshop](photoshop.md)&#x20;

I am really not a Photoshop expert. And because I use affinity photo for basic photo editing my reason for using Adobe Photoshop are these:

First it is the industry-standard application for doing photo editing. So I use it just to stay up to date with the latest updates.

Second in particular I really do take advantage of some of their AI features/filters. For example their tools to remove things from a photo are the best I've ever seen.

## ProCreate&#x20;

[**ProCreate**](procreate.md)&#x20;

Procreate is my mobile drawing application. Even though the Apple iPad is not a drawing tablet it really does serve that role very well when I am mobile.

And procreate really is so optimized for iPads and the drawing experience is incredibly responsive and pleasant.

I think if you have an iPad you have got to get procreate.

Procreate currently is still a one-time purchase application. And does not have a subscription plan.
