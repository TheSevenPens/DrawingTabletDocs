# 7P notes: Procreate

Procreate is my mobile drawing application. Even though the Apple iPad is not a drawing tablet it really does serve that role very well when I am mobile.

And procreate really is so optimized for iPads and the drawing experience is incredibly responsive and pleasant.

I think if you have an iPad you have got to get procreate.

Procreate currently is still a one-time purchase application. And does not have a subscription plan.
