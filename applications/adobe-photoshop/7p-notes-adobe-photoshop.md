## Adobe Photoshop

[Adobe Photoshop](../photoshop.md)&#x20;

I am really not a Photoshop expert. And because I use affinity photo for basic photo editing my reason for using Adobe Photoshop are these:

First it is the industry-standard application for doing photo editing. So I use it just to stay up to date with the latest updates.

Second in particular I really do take advantage of some of their AI features/filters. For example their tools to remove things from a photo are the best I've ever seen.
