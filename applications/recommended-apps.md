# Recommended apps

## Overview

I use a pretty small set of apps and mostly am doing illustration. So, this is a very limited list.

## My app recommendations

* [**Clip Studio Paint**](clip-studio-paint.md) - Medium Cost, Advanced, very powerful, multiplatform. Great for comics. For the kind of art I do, I am a huge fan of Clip Studio Paint. Nothing else has made me as productive.
* [**Krita**](krita.md) - FREE, Advanced, multiplatform. Very powerful. I use this when I want a natural media painting style. It's also the standard app I use for testing tablets.
* **Affinity Photo** - for basic photo editing
* [**ProCreate**](procreate.md) - When I draw on my iPad ProCreate is what I use most often.
* [Adobe Photoshop](photoshop.md) - Even though I use Affinity Photo for basic photo editing, I use Photoshop mostly for their neural/ai filters.
