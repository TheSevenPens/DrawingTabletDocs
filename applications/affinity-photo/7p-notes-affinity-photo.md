# 7P notes: Affinity Photo

**Affinity Photo** - for basic photo editing

For basic photo editing I use affinity photo. So for example basic color correction, or cropping, etcetera.

One of the great things about affinity photo is that it is a one time purchase. And as of yet there is no subscription plan. I know for some of you that will be very important.
