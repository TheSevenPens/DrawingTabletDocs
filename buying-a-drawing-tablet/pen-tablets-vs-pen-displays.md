# Pen tablets vs pen displays

Many people try pen displays and learn they don't enjoy using them and go back to pen tablets. For others, pen displays are the only kind of drawing tablet they can use. And then there are many people who switch between them depending on the need.

If you are unsure about which one to get or not sure how committed you are to using a drawing tablet, I recommend starting with a pen tablet.&#x20;

## Posture (winner: it depends)

Pen displays usually require someone to lean over a bit and looking down at the tablet to draw. That can place strain on your lower back. Many people give up on pen displays for this reason.

With pen tablets, you are drawing in a generally better posture.

## Cost (winner: pen tablets)

Pen tablets are cheaper. Even the most expensive pen tablet is cheaper than most pen displays.

## Reliability (winner: pen tablets)

Pen tablets are very simple devices compared to pen displays and have fewer things that go wrong.

## Cabling (winner: pen tablets)

Pen tablets work with a single USB cable (And some are wireless). Pen displays are more complex. Depending on your computer and which pen display there are multiple cabling options and sometimes they can be difficult to configure.

## Pointer lag (winner: pen tablets)

Pen tablets have less pointer lag than pen displays. More here: [lag](../guides/core-features/lag.md) &#x20;

## Wireless: (winner: pen tablets)

Many  pen tablets are wireless. No pen displays are wireless.

## Taking notes: (winner; pen displays)

Even though I don't recommend taking notes with pen displays. They are better at it for the simple reason they work more like a pen and paper.

## Fall damage: (winner: pen tablet)

A pen tablet will most likely survive falling off your desk. A pen display will most likely be damaged in unrepairable ways.

## Power requirements (winner: pen displays)

A pen tablet doesn't require much power. If connected to your laptop it won't drain the battery as much.

A pen display requires much more power. If connected to your laptop, it will draw much more power and run your battery down faster.

## Being able to see what you draw (winner: pen tablets)

Just like pen-and-paper, using a pen display means you will be seeing your hand and the pen. This pens that your hand and pen are covering up what you are drawing. Some people find this a bit irritating.

With pen tablets you always see exactly what you are drawing.&#x20;
