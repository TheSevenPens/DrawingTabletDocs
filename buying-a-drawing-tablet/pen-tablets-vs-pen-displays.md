# Pen tablets vs pen displays

Many people try pen displays and learn they don't enjoy using them and go back to pen tablets. For others, pen displays are the only kind of drawing tablet they can use. And then there are many people who switch between them depending on the need.

If you are unsure about which one to get or not sure how committed you are to using a drawing tablet, I recommend starting with a pen tablet.&#x20;
