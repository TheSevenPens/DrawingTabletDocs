# Drawing tablet recommendations

## Background reading

Before you look at the recommendations, I recommend you read:

* [Beginner's guide to drawing tablets](../../guides/beginners-guide.md)
* [Buying a drawing tablet](../)
* [Drawing tablet brands](../../drawing-tablet-brands/)&#x20;

## The recommendations by device type

* [**Pen tablets**](pen-tablets-recommendations.md) (tablets without a screen. Example: Wacom Intuos, etc.)
* [**Pen displays**](pen-displays-recommendations.md) (tablets with a screen. Example: Wacom Cintiq, etc.)
* [**Pen computers**](pen-computer-recommendations.md) (tablets with a screen that don't need a PC. Wacom Mobile Studio Pro)

## Notes on recommendations

* These are tablets I would personally recommend.
* I also identify specific tablets **that I explicitly do not recommend**.&#x20;
* I own many of these tablets. Each tablet entry has a section titled "7PENS Owns" which indicates whether I own the tablet.
* If I recommend a tablet that I do not own, that recommendation is based on reviews and observation of user feedback.&#x20;
* All the tablets I own are personal purchases. None for gifted to me or given as review units by a tablet manufacturer. [**Yes, I have a lot of tablets**](../../about-thesevenpens/my-tablets.md).
* These recommendations are centered around using the tablets for **drawing**.
