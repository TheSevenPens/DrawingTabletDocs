# Drawing tablet recommendations

## Background reading

Before you look at the recommendations, I recommend you read:

* [Beginner's guide to drawing tablets](../../guides/beginners-guide.md)
* [Buying a drawing tablet](../)
* [Drawing tablet brands](../../drawing-tablet-brands/)&#x20;

## The recommendations

* [**Pen tablets**](pen-tablets.md) (tablets without a screen: Wacom Intuos, etc.)
* [**Pen displays**](pen-displays.md) (tablets with a screen: Wacom Cintiqs, etc.)
* [**Pen computers**](pen-computer-recommendations-by-price-range.md) (tablets with a screen that don't need a PC: Apple iPads, etc.)

## Notes on my recommendations

* These are tablets I would personally recommend.
* I also identify specific tablets **that I explicitly do not recommend**.&#x20;
* I own many of these tablets. Each tablet entry has a section titled "7PENS Owns" which indicates whether I own the tablet.
* If I recommend a tablet that I do not own, that recommendation is based on reviews and observation of user feedback.&#x20;
* All the tablets I own are personal purchases. None for gifted to me or given as review units by a tablet manufacturer. [**Yes, I have a lot of tablets**](../../about-thesevenpens/my-tablets.md).
* These recommendations are centered around using the tablets for **drawing**.



### Recommendations for Wacom tablets

* All **Wacom Intuos Pro** models qualify for my recommended list.
* Most Wacom tablets in general qualify for my recommended list.&#x20;

### Model years

* Wacom tablets have been high-quality for years. So even if a model series started in 2017 (such as the Intuos Pro line) it is fine to purchase.
* However non-Wacom tablets are still catching up to Wacom in terms of quality and reliability.&#x20;
  * I would not recommend their tablets from a few years ago.&#x20;
  * I have only included their tablets made since 2021 for the most part.

### EMR drawing tablets

* I only recommend _true_ EMR drawing tablets, those are the tablets whose pens do not have any battery - rechargeable or otherwise.
* If you see a tablet that uses a pen that has a battery, do not purchase it.

### iPads

* Even though iPads are not drawing tablets, for the purposes of recommendations I treat them as pen computers. More here: [Using an iPad as a drawing tablet](../using-an-ipad-as-a-drawing-tablet.md)&#x20;
