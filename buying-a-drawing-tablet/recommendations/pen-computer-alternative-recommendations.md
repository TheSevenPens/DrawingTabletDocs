## Samsung Galaxy Tab&#x20;

Several of the Samsung Galaxy Tab S series of tablets will work well. &#x20;

* [**Samsung Galaxy Tab S6 Lite (2022 version)**](../../product-info/samsung/samsung-galaxy-tab-s6.md) ($240) is a good a low-cost option for beginners.&#x20;
* [**Samsung Galaxy Tab S9 FE** ](../../product-info/samsung/samsung-galaxy-tab-s9/)($500) excellent mid-budget option
* [**Samsung Galaxy Tab S9 Ultra** ](../../product-info/samsung/samsung-galaxy-tab-s9/)($1000) top-of-the-line performance.    &#x20;

## Microsoft Surface Pro

The **Surface Pro 8** (and above) is a good choice when combined with Surface Pro Signature Keyboard and Slim Pen 2.

Surface Pro 7 ands below do not have good pens for drawing. They exhibit too much line wobble.
