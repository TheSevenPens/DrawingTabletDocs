# Buying used drawing tablets

Buying a used tablet is an alternative if you want to save a little money

## My experience with used drawing tablets

I have bought and worked with MANY used drawing tablets - 26 used tablets as of October 2023. You can see the list here: [my tablets](../about-thesevenpens/my-tablets.md)&#x20;

* **pen tablets** - Pen tablets are generally very reliable devices and are fine to buy used I own many used pen tablets, some over 25+ years old that still work.
* **pen displays** - I have purchased one used pen display. So, I don't have a lot of experience with this.&#x20;
* **pen computers** - I have no experience with used pen computers. And in general I do not recommend pen computers. See: [The case against pen computers](the-case-against-pen-computers.md)&#x20;

## General considerations

Because the used tablets might be older models, you should prepare for issues that might arise due to their age. More here: [Using older drawing tablets](../guides/general/using-older-drawing-tablets.md)&#x20;

In particular you may need to use older drivers. This comes with its own set of complications. More here: [Using older tablet drivers](../guides/drivers/using-older-tablet-drivers.md)

## Which tablet brands to consider buying used

Wacom products have always been the most reliable and higher quality devices. So even going back years, their models work well  Because Wacom professional pen tablets are the very highest quality, those make great choices for buying used.

### Notes on Wacom drivers

* As of Wacom Driver 6.4.0 released in October 2022, Wacom has dropped support for Intuos 5 tablets and older Intuos tablets - except for the Wacom Intuos 4 XL which is still supported.
