# Buying used drawing tablets

Buying a used tablet is an alternative if you want to save a little money

## My experience with used drawing tablets

* **pen tablets** - Pen tablets are generally very reliable devices and are fine to buy used I own many used pen tablets, some over 25+ years old that still work.
* **pen displays** - I have purchased one used pen display. So, I don't have a lot of experience with this.&#x20;
* **pen computers** - I have no experience with used pen computers. And in general I do not recommend pen computers. See: [The case against pen computers](the-case-against-pen-computers.md)&#x20;

## Which tablet brands to consider buying used

Wacom products have always been the most reliable and higher quality devices. So even going back years, their models work well  Because Wacom professional pen tablets are the very highest quality, those make great choices for buying used.

### Notes on Wacom drivers

* As of Wacom Driver 6.4.0 released in October 2022, Wacom has dropped support for Intuos 5 tablets and older Intuos tablets - except for the Wacom Intuos 4 XL which is still supported.

## Inspecting a used tablet before you buy

If you have the opportunity to examine the tablet before you decide to buy, here are some things to check:

* **Basic test of functionality**&#x20;
  * Plug it in and test core features with an app like Krita
    * Check if the pen works in all locations
    * Check if the pressure smoothly going from zero to 100
    * Check tilt
    * Check that location of pen is tracked accurately in over the entire surface of the tablet
* **Express keys**
  * Check if all the buttons, dials, work. A quick way to test this is to map the buttons to keypresses. Then you can open a notepad app and press the express keys and see it typing things
* **Pen display features**
  * Check for stuck or dead pixels
  * Check for basic color and brightness
  * All pen displays have more pointer lag than pen tablets. Verify if you are OK with the amount it has.
  * All pen displays have some minor edge and corner inaccuracy in tracking the pen location. Check this to see how much there is and if you are OK with this.
  * Verify you are OK with the anti-glare sparkle on the screen. Some people are very sensitive to this.
* **Check surface**
  * There should be no cuts or scratches deep enough that you can feel them through the pen
*   **Check with your own device**

    * If you are buying on locally, see test it with your computer. For example, if you plan to use it with a laptop, bring that laptop with you to see if the connections work.&#x20;
