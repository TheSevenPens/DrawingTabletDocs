# Buying used drawing tablets

## Overview

We would all like to have completely brand new equipment. However used tablets maybe a way to save a little extra money.\`

## My experience with used drawing tablets

I have bought and worked with MANY used drawing tablets - 26 used tablets as of April 2024. You can see the list of all my tablets here: [my tablets](../about-thesevenpens/my-tablets.md)&#x20;

* **pen tablets** - Pen tablets are generally very reliable devices and are fine to buy used I own many used pen tablets, some over 25+ years old that still work.
* **pen displays** - I have purchased one used pen display.&#x20;
* **pen computers** - I have no experience with used pen computers. And in general I do not recommend pen computers. See: [The case against pen computers](the-case-against-pen-computers.md)&#x20;

## Tablet age

Because the used tablets might be older models, you should prepare for issues that might arise due to their age. More here: [Using older drawing tablets](../guides/general/using-older-drawing-tablets.md)&#x20;

## **Older drivers**&#x20;

In particular you may need to use older drivers. This comes with its own set of complications. More here: [Using older tablet drivers](../guides/drivers/using-older-tablet-drivers.md)

## Which brands for buying used

Wacom products have always been the most reliable and higher quality devices. So even going back years, their models work well. Because Wacom professional pen tablets are the very highest quality, those make great choices for buying used. More here: [drawing tablet brands](../drawing-tablet-brands/) &#x20;

## Used Wacom Intuos professional tablets

There are some factors you MUST take into account when buying them used. I've summarized those issues in this video below. In the description of the video, please make sure to note the errata.

Even though this video is about used pen tablets, I think it may be useful even if you are looking to purchase a used pen display.&#x20;

Likewise even though this video is about professional tablets, the topics raised also apply to consumer level tablets.

## Notes on Wacom drivers

* As of Wacom Driver 6.4.0 released in October 2022, Wacom has dropped support for Intuos 5 tablets and older Intuos tablets - except for the Wacom Intuos 4 XL which is still supported. ([https://cdn.wacom.com/u/productsupport/drivers/win/professional/releasenotes/Windows\_6.4.0.html](https://cdn.wacom.com/u/productsupport/drivers/win/professional/releasenotes/Windows\_6.4.0.html))

## Alternative to Wacom drivers for older tablets

* If you have an older tablet and need a driver check out [**OpenTabletDriver**](../guides/drivers/opentabletdriver/)&#x20;
* For creative work in Windows see [**Using OpenTabletDriver on Windows for drawing**](../guides/drivers/opentabletdriver/opentabletdriver-windows.md)

## Testing out a tablet before you buy

If you have the opportunity to examine the tablet before you decide to buy, here are some things: [Inspecting a tablet](inspecting-a-drawing-tablet-before-buying.md). &#x20;

## Buying online

You can find many tablets on eBay and I've had a good experience with the 25+ tablets I've bought from there

* All but 1 worked out-of-the-box
* Reading the item description...
  * I made sure the surface didn't have any visible signs of wear
  * That the tablet came with a pen
  * That the tablet came with the cables it needed - this is very important if the tablet used proprietary cables

## Tablet Manufacturers on eBay

Some manufacturers directly sell new and used/refurbished tablets on eBay

* Wacom: [https://www.ebay.com/str/wacom](https://www.ebay.com/str/wacom)&#x20;
* Huion: [https://www.ebay.com/str/huiontablet](https://www.ebay.com/str/huiontablet)&#x20;
* XP-Pen: [https://www.ebay.com/str/xppentechnology](https://www.ebay.com/str/xppentechnology)&#x20;

## Surface texture

A used tablet's surface might be almost pristine or it might be heavily used and exhibit a lot of surface wear.

* Ideally you get one that is not heavily worn.
* Small scratches or OK if they can not be felt through the pen.
* Larger scratches will interfere with your pen. You might be able mitigate that by using some surface protection. More here: [Surface protectors](../accessories/surface-protectors/)&#x20;

## Pens

Keep in mind you may get a nice price on a tablet, but it may not come with a pen. So verify whether a pen is included or not before you purchase.

If you need to buy a pen or you break your pen, keep in mind that&#x20;

* You have to make sure you find the exact model number of pen that is compatible with your tablet. A random pen from the same brand may not be compatible.
* Replacement pens can be very expensive even if they are a decade old. For example, older Wacom Pro Pens can be very expensive (>=$100).
* Replacement pens can be incredibly hard to find on the used market.&#x20;
* In the used market, sellers do not sell the pen by itself. So you may even have to purchase ANOTHER tablet with a pen. I've personally had to do this myself.&#x20;

## Nibs

Often, depending on the tablet and how you draw, the pen nib wears down as you use a pen.

* Verify whether your purchase includes spare nibs or not.
* Compatible nibs may be difficult to find.
* Compatible nibs may be difficult.&#x20;
