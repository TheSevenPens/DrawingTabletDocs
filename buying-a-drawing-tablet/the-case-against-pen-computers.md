# The case against pen computers

## Overview

Pen computers are drawing tablets with screens that you can use without being attached to a computer or a source of power. Essentially they are laptops that work with an EMR pen.

Even though some people love using pen computers, I do not in general recommend buying one.

## **Challenges with pen computers**

* They are incredibly expensive
* Limited or no upgradability
* Tablet manufacturers don't have as large or well tuned customer support&#x20;
* Getting repairs may be difficult
* Getting repairs is very expensive

## Alternatives to pen computers

Instead of pen computers, it would be better to look at related devices such as :

* Apple iPad Pro - See: [Using an iPad as a drawing tablet](using-an-ipad-as-a-drawing-tablet.md)&#x20;
* Microsoft Surface Pro 8 (and above).
