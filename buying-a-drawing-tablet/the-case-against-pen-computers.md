# The case against pen computers

## Overview

Pen computers are drawing tablets with screens that you can use without being attached to a computer or a source of power. Essentially they are laptops that work with an EMR pen.

Even though some people love using pen computers, I do not in general recommend buying one.

## **Challenges with pen computers**

### Cost

Pen computers are incredibly expensive.&#x20;

I certainly do not recommend pen computers for people who are just getting started with drawing tablets. I will always recommend that you go with cheaper alternatives. And the reason for this is simple: You may find that the wrong experience doesn't live up to your expectations.&#x20;

### Upgradability

Pen computers typically have very limited upgradability.

Typically once you buy pen computer you'll be stuck with those specifications in terms of memory processor speed and GPU for the entire lifetime of the device.

If you are going to purchase a pen computer please verify how upgradable it is before you make the purchase.

### Customer support

Companies like Apple microsoft dell etc make And sell a lot of laptops. In these companies have built world class support organizations And support systems to ensure that their customers are getting the help they need .When a customer has a question or something goes wrong with these complicated devices.&#x20;

The truth is that drawing tablet manufacturers aren't as big as companies like Apple or Microsoft. They certainly do not deal with the same volume of devices or users. So typically I find that their support teams have a harder time dealing with the issues of these kinds of devices.&#x20;

## Repairs

These systems are not meant to be user serviceable . So if something goes wrong it's Going to be difficult. to fix any problems yourselves Like most laptops and all in one systems a pen display is typically not intended to be user serviceable. So if something goes wrong it's going to be difficult to fix by yourself. Not only are these computers often not designed to be opened. Even if you are successful in opening the case and fixing whatever problem there is it will most certainly void your warranty.

And then if you need to have the pen computer repaired by the manufacturer. You are going to find that both the process is difficult and the cost is extraordinarily high.

For example you cannot take these devices into a local retail store for the manufacturer to take a look at. You'll have to send the pen computer back to the manufacturer and you will have to pay for the cost of shipping. And the repair cost can be as expensive as getting another laptop.
