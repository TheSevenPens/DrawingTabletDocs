# Buying a drawing tablet for osu!

Many people use drawing tablets to play osu. More here: [Gaming with a drawing tablet](../guides/use-cases/gaming-with-a-drawing-tablet.md)&#x20;

If you are interested in playing osu with a drawing tablet, then do not rely on recommendations from drawing tablet reviewers. They focus on the needs of the creative users. Don't rely on my recommendations for the same reason.&#x20;

Instead, the definitive resource to consult is [**Kuuube's tablet buying guide**](../resources/kuuubes-tablet-buying-guide.md).&#x20;

If you do want a quick answer now though, these two tablets are excellent for osu.
