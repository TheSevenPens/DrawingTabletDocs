## Choosing the type of drawing tablet

The most fundamental choice to make is the kind of drawing tablet you want:

* **pen tablet** (requires a computer)
* **pen display** (requires a computer)
* **standalone device -** either (1) a mobile computer with pen support or (2) a pen computer

Basic guidelines:

* Get a pen tablet (no screen) unless you are absolutely sure that you MUST have a pen display (has a screen). More here: [**Pen tablets vs pen displays**](pen-tablets-vs-pen-displays.md)
* If you really need need one that is standalone get an iPad or a Samsung Galaxy Tab.

## Brands

**If you want a safe choice, go with Wacom.** They are also the most expensive. Competitors such as Huion, XP-Pen, and Xencelabs are closing the gap with Wacom. This [**guide on drawing tablet brands**](../drawing-tablet-brands/) will help understand how to compare the brands.

If you decide on Wacom and want a pen tablet, read this guide: [**Overview of Wacom pen tablets**](../product-info/wacom/overview-of-wacom-pen-tablets.md). In the future, I'll add a doc covering Wacom pen displays.&#x20;

## Product info

I have links to information, reviews, and my notes on tablets in the [**product info**](../product-info/) section.

## **Core drawing tablet features**

* **Pressure -** The pen can detect how much pressure you are putting on its tip. The smallest pressure that activates the pen is called the Initial Activation Force (IAF). The maximum pressure is the most pressure the pen can detect. The pressure range is the difference between the maximum pressure and IAF. Here's what you should look for:
  * IAF - Lower IAF is better. I recommend getting a tablet that has a pen with an IAF of 3gf.&#x20;
  * Maximum pressure - At least 300gf. 400gf to 500gf would be preferable. 800gf is excellent.
  * Number of pressure levels - the pressure range is divided into many levels. Tablets advertise 8K pressure levels or above. This is all hype. All you need is 2K pressure levels. Pressure range matters at least as much as the number of pressure levels.
  * More info: [**pressure**](../guides/core-features/pen-pressure.md).&#x20;
* **Tilt -** Tilt support can be very useful for for certain kinds of artwork. Almost all modern tablets support tilt, except for some consumer tablets such as One by Wacom (CTL-472, CTL-672) and Wacom Intuos (CTL-6100, CTL-6100WL, CTL-4100, CTL-6100WL). Read more here about [**tilt**](../guides/core-features/pen-tilt.md).
* **EMR resolution -** This is how accurately the tablet can sense different positions of the pen. In other words, this is the tablet's ability to detect very tiny position changes. Most tablets have a reported LPI of 5080. 5080 lines per inch translates to 200 lines per mm. Without getting into details, Wacom tech is superior here, but if you are drawing you will not notice this.
* **Diagonal wobble** - All drawing tablets all have some wobble when moving the pen at an angle - it is strongest at 45 degrees. Some have a lot and some have very little or almost none. You may be very sensitive to the wobble. Be aware of this affect and make sure the tablet you buy doesn't have too much wobble. More here: [**diagonal wobble**](../guides/core-features/diagonal-wobble.md).

## **Secondary features**

* **ExpressKeys** - ExpressKeys are additional inputs (buttons, dials, scroll wheels, etc.) on the tablet. Some tablets have them and some don't. They allow you to easily perform certain tasks without touching the keyboard. You should decide if they are important for you. Read more here: [**ExpressKeys**](../guides/core-features/expresskeys.md)&#x20;
* **Touch** - A few drawing tablets support touch. Overall touch is not great. I do not recommend buying a drawing tablet if you expect the touch support to be on par with an iPad. You will be disappointed. More here: [**Touch support**](../guides/touch-support.md)

## Pen display topics

* **Connection** - Make sure you have an understanding of [**how a pen display is going to connect to your computer**](../guides/connections-and-cabling/connecting-a-pen-display.md). SOME pen displays work with only a single USB-C cable. Some don't. Even if a pen display support its, your computer may not. More here: [**Connecting a pen display with one USB-C cable**](../guides/connections-and-cabling/connecting-a-pen-display-with-one-usb-c-cable.md) &#x20;
* **Anti-glare sparkle** - To prevent glare, pen displays have an anti-glare treatment applied to them. This will produce a kind sparkle effect. Some pen displays have a lot of it and some a little. Some people can tolerate it. Some people hate seeing it. More here: [**Anti-glare sparkle**](../guides/pen-displays/anti-glare-sparkle.md).  &#x20;
* **Display resolution** - Choosing the [**display resolution**](../guides/pen-displays/display-resolution.md).&#x20;
* **Parallax -** Parallax is the apparent disagreement between the location of the physical tip of the pen and the and where the computer thinks the tip of the pen is. This is another thing, some people are more sensitive to. Learn more here: [**parallax**](../guides/pen-displays/parallax.md).&#x20;
* **Lamination** - Lamination can decrease parallax. I highly recommend getting a pen display that has lamination. Learn more here: [**lamination**](../guides/pen-displays/lamination.md) &#x20;
* **NO SIGNAL** - The most common problem with pen displays is something called NO SIGNAL. If you are interested in pen displays you should be prepared to deal with this topic. [**See Troubleshoot the NO SIGNAL problem**](../troubleshooting/troubleshoot-no-signal.md).
* Even though a pen display is meant to draw on you can use it exactly like a normal monitor. Learn more here: [**Using a pen display as a monitor**](../guides/customizing-your-experience/using-a-pen-display-as-a-monitor.md).

## Connectivity: wired and wireless

* **Pen tablets** can all be connected with a single USB cable. Most pen tablets even support wireless connectivity - usually via Bluetooth. **Be aware** that many tablet models have wireless and non-wireless versions with slightly different names and model numbers. Be sure which one you are buying.
* **Pen displays** require at least 1 cable. As the pen display size starts getting to 16" and above, they tend to require at least 2 cables due to the increased power required by the display.&#x20;

## Computer compatibility

Drawing tablets work with:

* Macs
* PCs running Windows. More here: [**Using a drawing tablet on Windows**](../guides/operating-systems/windows/using-a-drawing-tablet-on-windows.md) &#x20;
* PCs running Linux. More here: [**Using a drawing tablet with Linux**](../guides/operating-systems/linux.md) &#x20;
* iPads to a very limited extent. More here: [**Using a drawing tablet with an iOS device**](../guides/general/using-a-drawing-tablet-with-an-ios-device.md)  &#x20;
* Android devices to some extent. More here: [**Using a drawing tablet with an Android device**](../guides/operating-systems/using-a-drawing-tablet-with-an-android-device.md) &#x20;
* Chromebooks to some extent. More here: [**Using drawing tablets with Chromebooks**](../guides/operating-systems/using-a-drawing-tablet-with-a-chromebook.md) &#x20;

## Ergonomics

* **Size** - Tablets come in a variety of sizes. The size has a BIG impact on the ergonomics of using the tablet. And different sizes serve different user needs. This guide on [**choosing the right tablet size**](../guides/customizing-your-experience/choosing-the-right-tablet-size.md) will help you find a size size that works for you.
* **Thickness** - Pen tablets are very then these days - about 8mm. Pen displays are thicker. Smaller pen displays can be around 10mm but as their size grows they get thicker - for example 35mm.&#x20;
* **Surface texture** - If you are drawing, you might have strong preferences of what the texture of your tablet feels like. All drawing tablets have some surface texture but there is quite a bit of variation. There are even ways to achieve the texture you want. For example, many people want their tablet to have a rougher texture like paper. Learn more here: [**Surface texture**](../guides/core-features/surface-texture.md)&#x20;
* **Posture** - With a pen tablet, your torso will naturally have a more vertical posture. This is because you will be looking at your monitor while you hand rests on the pen tablet which is on your desk.  With a pen display, you will be leaning over a bit to draw since you must look at the pen tablet on you desk. You may experience lower back pain or strain on your neck from looking down.&#x20;
* **Arm mounting** - Pen displays are essentially monitors, and many (but not all), pen displays have a VESA mount on the back that you can put the pen display on. This will allow you to use keep the pen display away and use it like a secondary display and then pull it close when you want to draw. Pen tablets do not have any kind of built in ability to be mounted like that. See: [**Using monitor arms with a pen display**](../guides/customizing-your-experience/using-monitor-arms-with-a-pen-display.md)&#x20;
* **Legs** - Many pen displays (not not all) have foldable legs on the back. This allows you to keep the pen display at a slight angle on your desk which makes it a bit easier to see and draw on. Pen tablets do not have legs. If you want to place them at an angle, you will need to find some other solution.
* **Right-handed vs left-handed use** - All drawing tablets work for people who are right-handed or left-handed. In some cases (usually due to the layout of the tablet buttons) you may need to configure the tablet to be used correctly in a left-handed way. See [**handedness of drawing tablets**](../guides/ergonomics/handedness-of-drawing-tablets.md).&#x20;
* **Noise** - You may have strong preferences about **noise**. Generally drawing tablets are considered very quiet, and some are completely silent. More details here: [**Noise**](./#noise)&#x20;
* **Heat** - Drawing tablets are either room temperature or slightly warm depending on the kind of drawing tablet. More here: [**Heat**](../guides/ergonomics/heat.md)&#x20;

## Usage scenarios

* **Drawing** - Drawing with a drawing tablet very similar to but different from drawing on paper. And there is a big difference between how it feels to draw with pen displays versus pen tablets. You must understand the differences to help you choose between a pen tablet or pen display. More here: [**The drawing experience**](../basics/the-drawing-experience.md) and here [**Learning digital art**](../guides/learning-digital-art.md)
* **Taking notes** - I don't typically recommend drawing tablets for note taking. But some people really do like doing this. Instead I suggest standalone devices like an iPad which I think work much better. More here: [**Taking notes with drawing tablets**](../guides/use-cases/taking-notes-with-drawing-tablets.md)&#x20;
* **Educational videos** - You've probably seen those Khan academy videos. Those are done with a drawing tablet. More here: making educational videos. More here: [**Making educational videos with a drawing tablet**](../guides/use-cases/making-educational-videos-with-a-drawing-tablet.md)
* **Gaming** - some people actually play games with drawing tablets. More here: [**Gaming with a drawing tablet**](../guides/use-cases/gaming-with-a-drawing-tablet.md)&#x20;
* **Playing osu!** - If you want to play osu!, there are very specific drawing tablets you should consider. More here: [**Buying a drawing tablet for osu!**](buying-a-drawing-tablet-for-osu.md) &#x20;

## Applications

There are a lot of applications that work well with pen tablets depending on what you want to do. More here: [**Applications**](../applications/). Here are the apps I specifically use: [**Recommended apps**](../applications/recommended-apps.md)&#x20;

## Buying used drawing tablets

If you buy a used tablet, you could save yourself some significant money but you should be prepared for the issues you might face buying a used tablet. More here: [**Buying a used tablet**](buying-used-drawing-tablets.md)    &#x20;

## Power

Depending on the kind of tablet it will draw different amounts of power. Pen tablets requrie very little. Pen displays need much more. Some pen tablets even have batteries so that they can work wirelessly. More here: [Powering a drawing tablet](../guides/core-features/powering-a-drawing-tablet.md)&#x20;

## Model years

Drawing tablets have been released over many years. That means when you shop online you are going to be seeing many models both old and new and that can get very confusing.&#x20;

General guidelines:&#x20;

* **Wacom** - Wacom models from any year are good quality. However keep in mind over time their latest drivers will drop support for older models.&#x20;
* **Huion & XP-Pen** - I recommend you only get models released in 2021 or later. &#x20;

## Preparing for a drawing tablet

* **Troubleshooting -** At some point, something is going to go wrong. I highly suggest you familiarize yourself with the [**Common problems with drawing tablets**](../troubleshooting/common-problems-with-drawing-tablets.md) and be aware of these [**Troubleshooting guides**](../troubleshooting/).
* **Accessories** - There are some interesting accessories for a tablet. More here:[ **Accessories**  ](../accessories/)
* **Purchasing** - Before you actually purchase the tablet. Go through this [**Before-purchase checklist**](before-purchase-checklist.md).
* **Getting started** - Once you get your tablet, here's a guide to setting it up for the first time: [**Get started with a drawing tablet**](../guides/get-started-with-a-drawing-tablet.md)&#x20;
* **Maintenance** - Once you get your tablet, you'll need to take care of it and perform some simple maintenance. I've written a guide on this: [**Caring for your tablet**](../guides/caring-for-your-tablet/).
