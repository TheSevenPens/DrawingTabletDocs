# Buying a drawing tablet

Updated: 2023/08/23

## Intro

I want to help you make an informed choice when purchasing a drawing tablet. My goals are to (1) save you money, (2) ensure you aren't disappointed with your purchase, and (3) prevent you from damaging your tablet or pen.

## Read the beginner's guide if needed

If you are new to drawing table, read this first: [**Beginner's guide to drawing tablets**](../guides/beginners-guide.md). This buying guide builds on the beginner's guide.

## My recommendations

If you are ready to buy a tablet, go ahead to [**my tablet recommendations**](recommendations/). Those recommendations should help you narrow your search. The recommendations cover pen tablets, pen displays, and pen computers across multiple price ranges.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
I strongly urge you to read this buying guide and beginner's guide completely before you jump directly to the recommendations. &#x20;
{% endhint %}

## Choosing the type of drawing tablet

The most fundamental choice to make is the kind of drawing tablet you want:

* **pen tablet** (EMR sensor; requires a computer)
* **pen display** (EMR sensor + screen; requires a computer)
* **pen computer** (EMR sensor + screen + CPU + storage; does not require a computer because it is a computer)

To keep it simple:

* Get a pen tablet (no screen) unless you are absolutely sure that you MUST have a pen display (has a screen).
* Do not get a pen computer, instead get an alternative like an iPad. More here along with alternatives:  [**I don't recommend pen computers**](the-case-against-pen-computers.md) &#x20;

## Brands

**If you want a safe choice, go with Wacom.** They are also the most expensive. Since 2021 **competitors like Huion, XP-Pen, and Xencelabs** are closing the gap with Wacom.

This guide on [**brands**](../drawing-tablet-brands/) will help understand how to compare the brands.

If you decide on Wacom and want a pen tablet, read this guide: [**Overview of Wacom pen tablets**](../drawing-tablet-brands/wacom/overview-of-wacom-pen-tablets.md). In the future I'll add a doc covering Wacom pen displays.&#x20;

## My notes on drawing tablets

I own A LOT of drawing tablets. Although I don't write tablet reviews, I do share notes of what I find interesting. See my notes here: [**7P notes**](broken-reference)&#x20;

## Pen tablets vs pen displays

<mark style="color:red;">**Pen displays are NOT inherently than pen tablets. It really depends on how you draw, your body and ergonomic situation, etc.**</mark> Throughout this buying guide, you'll see areas where pen tablets and pen computers are compared. More here: [**Pen tablets vs pen displays**](./#pen-tablets-vs-pen-displays)

## The drawing experience

Drawing with a drawing tablet ideally is very similar to drawing paper. But there are key differences. And especially there is a big difference between pen displays and pen tablets. You should absolutely understand the differences to help you choose between a pen tablet or pen display. More here: [**The drawing experience**](./#the-drawing-experience)

## **Core drawing tablet features**

### **Pressure**

* **Number of pressure levels -** These days all tablet manufacturers list 8192 pressure levels. Realistically though 2048 is all you need.&#x20;
* **Pressure range** - more important than number of pressure levels is the pressure range. Wacom pens are generally known for having a very wide pressure range including a very low Initial Activation Force (IAF) which makes it easier to draw finer lines. Read more about [**pressure**](../guides/core-features/pen-pressure.md).

### **Tilt**

* **Tilt** support can be very useful for for certain kinds of artwork. Though, many people rarely or never use this feature.
* Wacom's consumer pen tablets such as **One by Wacom** and **Intuos** do not offer tilt. For some people that's fine since they never or rarely use tilt. Only Wacom's Intuos Pro line supports tilt.&#x20;
* Non-Wacom brands tend to have tilt on every tablet no matter the cost.
* Read more here about [**tilt**](../guides/core-features/pen-tilt.md).

### **Accuracy > EMR sensing resolution**&#x20;

This is how accurately the tablet can sense different positions of the pen. In other words, this is the tablet's ability to detect very tiny position changes. Most tablets have a reported LPI of 5080. 5080 lines per inch translates to 200 lines per mm.&#x20;

Without getting into the details despite all manufacturers advertising 5080 LPI for their tablets, Wacom's resolution is better. Having said that, the ways in which other manufacturers are different will not be noticeable to you when drawing.

### Accuracy > Diagonal wobble

All drawing tablets all have some wobble when moving the pen at an angle - it is strongest at 45 degrees. Some have a lot and some have very little or almost none. You may be very sensitive to the wobble. Be aware of this affect and make sure the tablet you buy doesn't have too much wobble. More here: [**diagonal wobble**](../guides/core-features/diagonal-wobble/).

### **ExpressKeys**&#x20;

ExpressKeys are additional inputs (buttons, dials, scroll wheels, etc.) on the tablet. Some tablets have them and some don't. They allow you to easily perform certain tasks without touching the keyboard. You should decide if they are important for you. Read more here: [**ExpressKeys**](../guides/core-features/expresskeys.md)

## Pen display topics

* **Connection** - Make sure you have an understanding of [**how a pen display is going to connect to your computer**](../guides/pen-displays/connecting-a-pen-display.md).
* **Single cable connection** - SOME pen displays work with only a single USB-C cable. Some don't. Even if a pen display support its, your computer may not. More here: [**Connecting a pen display with one USB-C cable**](../guides/pen-displays/connecting-a-pen-display-with-one-usb-c-cable.md) &#x20;
* **Anti-glare sparkle** - Understand the impact of [**Anti-glare sparkle**](../guides/pen-displays/anti-glare-sparkle.md). Some pen displays have a lot of it and some a little. Some people can tolerate it. Some people hate seeing it. &#x20;
* **Display resolution** - Choosing the [**display resolution**](../guides/pen-displays/display-resolution.md).&#x20;
* **Parallax -** Parallax is the apparent disagreement between the location of the physical tip of the pen and the and where the computer thinks the tip of the pen is. Learn more here: [**parallax**](../guides/pen-displays/parallax.md).&#x20;
* **Lamination** - Lamination can decrease parallax. I highly recommend getting a pen display that has lamination. Learn more here: [**lamination**](../guides/pen-displays/lamination.md) &#x20;
* **NO SIGNAL** - The most common problem with pen displays is something called NO SIGNAL. If you are interested in pen displays you should be prepared to deal with this topic. [**See Troubleshoot the NO SIGNAL problem**](../troubleshooting/troubleshoot-no-signal.md).

## Connectivity: wired and wireless

**Pen tablets** can all be connected with a single USB cable. Most pen tablets even support wireless connectivity - usually via Bluetooth.

**Pen displays** require at least 1 cable. As the pen display size starts getting to 16" and above, they tend to require at least 2 cables due to the increased power required by the display.&#x20;

## Power: power requirements

**Pen tablets** require minimal amounts of power. They get enough power from a normal USB 2.0 port.

**Pen displays** require much more power than a pen tablet due to the embedded display panel. They may have a power adapter that you need to plug into the wall. Or they may be able to be powered with through a USB-C cable.

## Power: batteries

**Pen tablets** that have wireless support have built-in batteries that can usually last the entire day and do recharge quickly when they are plugged back in.

**Pen displays** DO NOT have batteries. They must get their power from a cable that is either attached to a computer or to power coming from a wall.

## Operating system information

### OS compatibility

* The issue of compatibility is not with the hardware, it is with the drivers that you need to install on your computer.
* Windows & MacOS
  * All modern drawing tablets drivers are compatible with Windows and MacOS.
* Linux:
  * Some tablets have drivers that are compatible with Linux
  * NOTE: I don't have any experience with using tablets with Linux. So I can't really speak to how well they work in this scenario.&#x20;

### Windows: 32-bit vs 64-bit&#x20;

If you have a 32-bit Windows computer, you should verify whether the tablet driver works on those systems by contacting their support. Some tablet manufacturers have dropped support in their drivers for those 32-bit Windows systems. This means that you might be forced to use older drivers.&#x20;

Wacom: [https://support.wacom.com/hc/en-us/articles/1500006262281-Does-Wacom-support-Windows-32-bit-Operating-Systems-](https://support.wacom.com/hc/en-us/articles/1500006262281-Does-Wacom-support-Windows-32-bit-Operating-Systems-)

## Applications

There are a lot of applications that work well with pen tablets depending on what you want to do. More here: [**Applications**](../applications/).

## Scenarios

### Taking notes

I don't recommend drawing tablets for note taking. Devices like an iPad work much better. More here: [**Taking notes with drawing tablets**](../guides/use-cases/taking-notes-with-drawing-tablets.md)&#x20;

### Playing osu!

So if you intend to using a drawing tablet for playing **osu!,** then **DO NOT** rely on my recommendations at this site. My recommendations are for drawing, and if you are playing osu! you need to consider other factors and will have more demanding requirements.&#x20;

So for osu!, consult [**Kuuube's tablet buying guide**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1DYVfiSpQqdpa4sWWYUALPmliOIuGyKog7B7LJJdmlhE/edit#gid=2077726645).&#x20;

## Ergonomics

### Size

Tablets come in a variety of sizes. The size has a BIG impact on the ergonomics of using the tablet. And different sizes serve different user needs. This guide on [**choosing the right tablet size**](../guides/core-features/choosing-the-right-tablet-size.md) will help you find a size size that works for you.

### Thickness

Pen tablets are very then these days - about 8mm.

Pen displays are thicker. Smaller pen displays can be around 10mm but as their size grows they get thicker - for example 35mm.&#x20;

### Surface texture

If you are drawing, you might have strong preferences of what the texture of your tablet feels like. All drawing tablets have some surface texture but there is quite a bit of variation. There are even ways to achieve the texture you want. For example, many people want their tablet to have a rougher texture like paper.

Learn more here: [**Surface texture**](../guides/core-features/surface-texture.md)&#x20;

### Posture

With a pen tablet, your torso will naturally have a more vertical posture. This is because you will be looking at your monitor while you hand rests on the pen tablet which is on your desk.&#x20;

With a pen display, you will be leaning over a bit to draw since you must look at the pen tablet on you desk. You may experience lower back pain or strain on your neck from looking down.&#x20;

### Arm mounting

Pen displays are essentially monitors, and many (but not all), pen displays have a VESA mount on the back that you can put the pen display on. This will allow you to use keep the pen display away and use it like a secondary display and then pull it close when you want to draw.

See: [Using monitor arms with a pen display](../guides/pen-displays/using-monitor-arms-with-a-pen-display.md)&#x20;

Pen tablets do not have any kind of built in ability to be mounted like that.

### Legs

Many pen displays (not not all) have foldable legs on the back. This allows you to keep the pen display at a slight angle on your desk which makes it a bit easier to see and draw on.

Pen tablets do not have legs. If you want to place them at an angle, you will need to find some other solution.

### Right-handed vs left-handed use

All drawing tablets work for people who are right-handed or left-handed. For those tablets with buttons or ports on one side, you may you find it more convenient to rotate the tablet around so that the buttons or ports are one the opposite side. This rotation. This is supported by most tablets. See: [**Rotating a drawing tablet**](../guides/ergonomics/rotating-a-drawing-tablet.md).

## Maintaining your tablet

Once you get your tablet, you'll need to take care of it and perform some simple maintenance. I've written a guide on this: [**Caring for your tablet**](../guides/caring-for-your-tablet/).

### Surface protection

The surface of a tablet is subject to wear. You should understand what options there are to protect the surface. See: [**protective sheets**](../accessories/protective-sheets.md).

## Other guidance

### Model years

Drawing tablets have been released over many years. That means when you shop online you are going to be seeing many models both old and new and that can get very confusing.&#x20;

General guidelines:&#x20;

* **Wacom** - Wacom models from any year are good quality. However keep in mind over time their latest drivers will drop support for older models.&#x20;
* **Huion & XP-Pen** - I recommend you only get models released in 2021 or later. &#x20;

### Buying used drawing tablets

If you buy a used tablet, you could save yourself some significant money but you should be prepared for the issues you might face buying a used tablet. More here: [**Buying a used tablet**](buying-used-drawing-tablets.md)    &#x20;

### Hardware reliability

Pen tablets overall are much simpler devices than pen displays. As a consequence they are much more reliable.

### Model names vs model numbers

Tablet names are confusingly similar. So much so, that I've seen people order the wrong tablet just because the names were close.

Here is an example. Wacom has two tablets with similar names but that are very different: **Wacom One** (a pen display) and **One by Wacom** (a pen tablet). More about the differences here: [Wacom One vs One by Wacom](../drawing-tablet-brands/wacom/wacom-one-vs-one-by-wacom.md)&#x20;

* NEVER order by using the name of the tablet alone.
* ALWAYS verify you have ordered correct model number.

### Reviews&#x20;

<mark style="color:red;">**Never purchase a tablet without looking at the reviews first.**</mark>

Some reviewers to explore:
