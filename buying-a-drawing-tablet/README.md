# Buying a drawing tablet

Updated: 2023/08/23

## Intro

I want to help you make an informed choice when purchasing a drawing tablet. My goals are to (1) save you money, (2) ensure you aren't disappointed with your purchase, and (3) prevent you from damaging your tablet or pen.

## Read the beginner's guide if needed

If you are new to drawing table, read this first: [**Beginner's guide to drawing tablets**](../guides/beginners-guide.md). This buying guide builds on the beginner's guide.

## My recommendations

If you are ready to buy a tablet, go ahead to [**my tablet recommendations**](recommendations/). Those recommendations should help you narrow your search. The recommendations cover pen tablets, pen displays, and pen computers across multiple price ranges.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
I strongly urge you to read this buying guide and beginner's guide completely before you jump directly to the recommendations. &#x20;
{% endhint %}

## Choosing the type of drawing tablet

The most fundamental choice to make is the kind of drawing tablet you want:

* **pen tablet** (EMR sensor; requires a computer)
* **pen display** (EMR sensor + screen; requires a computer)
* **pen computer** (EMR sensor + screen + CPU + storage; does not require a computer because it is a computer)

To keep it simple:

* Get a pen tablet (no screen) unless you are absolutely sure that you MUST have a pen display (has a screen).
* Do not get a pen computer, instead get an alternative like an iPad. More here along with alternatives:  [**I don't recommend pen computers**](the-case-against-pen-computers.md) &#x20;

## Brands

**If you want a safe choice, go with Wacom.** They are also the most expensive. Since 2021 **competitors like Huion, XP-Pen, and Xencelabs** are closing the gap with Wacom.

This guide on [**brands**](../drawing-tablet-brands/) will help understand how to compare the brands.

If you decide on Wacom and want a pen tablet, read this guide: [**Overview of Wacom pen tablets**](../drawing-tablet-brands/wacom/overview-of-wacom-pen-tablets.md). In the future I'll add a doc covering Wacom pen displays.&#x20;

## My notes on drawing tablets

I own A LOT of drawing tablets. Although I don't write tablet reviews, I do share notes of what I find interesting. See my notes here: [**7P notes**](../7p-notes/)&#x20;

## Pen tablets vs pen displays

<mark style="color:red;">**Pen displays are NOT inherently than pen tablets. It really depends on how you draw, your body and ergonomic situation, etc.**</mark> Throughout this buying guide, you'll see areas where pen tablets and pen computers are compared. More here: [**Pen tablets vs pen displays**](./#pen-tablets-vs-pen-displays)

## Size

Tablets come in a variety of sizes. The size has a BIG impact on the ergonomics of using the tablet. And different sizes serve different user needs. This guide on [**choosing the right tablet size**](../guides/core-features/choosing-the-right-tablet-size.md) will help you find a size size that works for you.

## **ExpressKeys**&#x20;

ExpressKeys are additional inputs (buttons, dials, scroll wheels, etc.) on the tablet. Some tablets have them and some don't. They allow you to easily perform certain tasks without touching the keyboard. You should decide if they are important for you. Read more here: [**ExpressKeys**](../guides/core-features/expresskeys.md)

## Model years

Drawing tablets have been released over many years. That means when you shop online you are going to be seeing many models both old and new and that can get very confusing.&#x20;

General guidelines:&#x20;

* **Wacom** - Wacom models from any year are good quality. However keep in mind over time their latest drivers will drop support for older models.&#x20;
* **Huion & XP-Pen** - I recommend you only get models released in 2021 or later. &#x20;

## Pen display topics

* **Connection** - Make sure you have an understanding of [**how a pen display is going to connect to your computer**](../guides/pen-displays/connecting-a-pen-display.md).
* **Single cable connection** - SOME pen displays work with only a single USB-C cable and some don't support that. Even if they do support it, your computer may not. More here: [**Connecting a pen display with one USB-C cable**](../guides/pen-displays/connecting-a-pen-display-with-one-usb-c-cable.md) &#x20;
* **Anti-glare sparkle** - Understand the impact of [**Anti-glare sparkle**](../guides/pen-displays/anti-glare-sparkle.md). Some pen displays have a lot of it and some a little. Some people can tolerate it. Some people hate seeing it. &#x20;
* **Display Resolution** - Choosing the [**display resolution**](../guides/pen-displays/display-resolution.md).&#x20;
* **Parallax -** Parallax is the apparent disagreement between the location of the physical tip of the pen and the and where the computer thinks the tip of the pen is. Learn more here: [**parallax**](../guides/pen-displays/parallax.md).&#x20;
* **Lamination** - Lamination decreases parallax substantially. I highly recommend getting a pen display that has lamination. Learn more here: [**lamination**](../guides/pen-displays/lamination.md) &#x20;
* **Needs a computer** - A pen display still requires you to have a computer to use it.
* **NO SIGNAL** - The most common problem with pen displays is something called NO SIGNAL. If you are interested in pen displays you should be prepared to deal with this topic. [**See Troubleshoot the NO SIGNAL problem**](../troubleshooting/troubleshoot-no-signal.md).

## Surface protection

The surface of a tablet is subject to wear. You should understand what options there are to protect the surface. See: [**protective sheets**](../accessories/protective-sheets.md).

## Connectivity: wired and wireless

Pen tablets can all be connected with a single USB cable. Most pen tablets even support wireless connectivity - usually via Bluetooth.

Pen displays require at least 1 cable. As the pen display size starts getting to 16" and above, they tend to require at least 2 cables due to the increased power required by the display.&#x20;

## Power: power requirements

Pen tablets require minimal amounts of power. They get enough power from a normal USB 2.0 port.

Pen displays require much more power than a pen tablet due to the embedded display panel. They may have a power adapter that you need to plug into the wall. Or they may be able to be powered with through a USB-C cable.

## Power: batteries

Pen tablets that have wireless support have built-in batteries that can usually last the entire day and do recharge quickly when they are plugged back in.

Pen displays DO NOT have batteries. They must get their power from a cable that is either attached to a computer or to power coming from a wall.

## Requirement to use a computer&#x20;

* Pen tablets must be used with a computer.
* Pen displays must be used with a computer.
* Pen computers ARE computers and can be used by themselves.

## Operating system information

### OS compatibility

* The issue of compatibility is not with the hardware, it is with the drivers that you need to install on your computer.
* Windows & MacOS
  * All modern drawing tablets drivers are compatible with Windows and MacOS.
* Linux:
  * Some tablets have drivers that are compatible with Linux
  * NOTE: I don't have any experience with using tablets with Linux. So I can't really speak to how well they work in this scenario.&#x20;

### Windows: 32-bit vs 64-bit&#x20;

If you have a 32-bit Windows computer, you should verify whether the tablet driver works on those systems by contacting their support. Some tablet manufacturers have dropped support in their drivers for those 32-bit Windows systems. This means that you might be forced to use older drivers.&#x20;

Wacom: [https://support.wacom.com/hc/en-us/articles/1500006262281-Does-Wacom-support-Windows-32-bit-Operating-Systems-](https://support.wacom.com/hc/en-us/articles/1500006262281-Does-Wacom-support-Windows-32-bit-Operating-Systems-)



## Hardware reliability

Pen tablets overall are much simpler devices than pen displays. As a consequence they are much more reliable.

## Fall damage

You should never let your tablet drop to the floor. It can be damaged.

A pen tablet, has fewer moving parts and most of the time nothing bad will happen to it.

However, If you drop a pen display, you almost certainly will cause significant damage that cannot be repaired. For example, any of these things can happen:

* The pen displays will not turn on again
* The screen will crack
* The display panel will break and not show a full screen or will show random color patterns
* The ports can get damaged, preventing it from getting a display signal&#x20;

## Model names vs model numbers

Tablet names are confusingly similar. So much so, that I've seen people order the wrong tablet just because the names were close.

Here is an example. Wacom has two tablets with similar names but that are very different: **Wacom One** (a pen display) and **One by Wacom** (a pen tablet). More about the differences here: [Wacom One vs One by Wacom](../drawing-tablet-brands/wacom/wacom-one-vs-one-by-wacom.md)&#x20;

* NEVER order by using the name of the tablet alone.
* ALWAYS verify you have ordered correct model number.

## Pointer lag

The operating system pointer (i.e. the mouse pointer) will lag behind the physical tip of the pen as you move it.&#x20;

* Pen tablets have virtually no pointer lag.
* Apple iPads with the Apple pencil have very little pointer lag.&#x20;
* Pen displays have very noticeable pointer lag. None come close to an iPad or a pen tablet. &#x20;

If you are getting a pen display, then you should absolutely research how much pointer lag it has. More here: [**Lag**](../guides/core-features/lag.md)&#x20;

## **Drawing: getting strokes right the first time**

Because you can see exactly where the stroke is going to be, Many people who use pen displays say that they get the stroke right the first time.&#x20;

And they say that with a pen tablet, they would have to make the stroke several times to get it right and press undo to erase the mistakes.&#x20;

I would generally agree with that. and when I want to do some line work quicker than normal, I will often move from a pen tablet to a pen display to get.

## Drawing: matching hand movements and drawing

With a **pen display**, things are natural. You see the pen in the same place the stroke is being drawn - just like a piece of paper.

One of the downsides to this is of course, your own hand and the pen will block your eyes from seeing the display - just like paper. The easy solution to this is to reposition your eyes or take advantage of the canvas zoom and rotation features of your drawing app.

With a **pen tablet**, you are looking at a monitor but drawing somewhere else with your hand. Fundamentally this is no different than using a mouse.&#x20;

Just like a mouse, the operating system and drawing programs will usually show the position of the pen on the canvas, so you will have some visual feedback of the position of the pen even if you are not drawing.

One advantage of this disconnect is that the pen and your hand do not block your visibility of what you are drawing. That is a nice convenience.

Still, some people struggle with the disconnect .Usually they can train themselves out of this within a complex of weeks. But some people just can't get used to it.

## Drawing: quality of art you can make

Some people worry that the quality of art they want to produce can only be produced by a pen display. You shouldn't let that worry you. People have been producing amazing art with pen tablets for decades. There are definitely some benefits to using a pen display, but the quality of art than can be made is not a factor.

## Drawing: matching aspect ratios

With a pen display, the active are and the screen have the same size. This means the pen will draw exactly where you see it draw.

With a pen tablet, the active area where you raw is separate from the monitor where you see the your strokes. Unless specifically configured in the driver, this will cause your strokes to be distorted. For example if you draw a circle on the tablet it will show up as an oval on the screen. It is easy to fix this problem in the driver. More here: [**match aspect ratios between pen tablets and monitors**](../guides/core-features/active-area-aspect-ratio.md).

## **Pressure**

* **Number of pressure levels -** These days all tablet manufacturers list 8192 pressure levels. Realistically though 2048 is all you need.&#x20;
* **Pressure range** - more important than number of pressure levels is the pressure range. Wacom pens are generally known for having a very wide pressure range including a very low Initial Activation Force (IAF) which makes it easier to draw finer lines. Read more about [**pressure**](../guides/core-features/pen-pressure.md).

## **Tilt**

* **Tilt** support can be very useful for for certain kinds of artwork. Though, many people rarely or never use this feature.
* Wacom's consumer pen tablets such as **One by Wacom** and **Intuos** do not offer tilt. For some people that's fine since they never or rarely use tilt. Only Wacom's Intuos Pro line supports tilt.&#x20;
* Non-Wacom brands tend to have tilt on every tablet no matter the cost.
* Read more here about [**tilt**](../guides/core-features/pen-tilt.md).

## **EMR sensing resolution**&#x20;

This is how accurately the tablet can sense different positions of the pen. In other words, this is the tablet's ability to detect very tiny position changes. Most tablets have a reported LPI of 5080. 5080 lines per inch translates to 200 lines per mm.&#x20;

Without getting into the details despite all manufacturers advertising 5080 LPI for their tablets, Wacom's resolution is better. Having said that, the ways in which other manufacturers are different will not be noticeable to you when drawing.

## Diagonal wobble

All drawing tablets all have some wobble when moving the pen at an angle - it is strongest at 45 degrees. Some have a lot and some have very little or almost none. You may be very sensitive to the wobble. Be aware of this affect and make sure the tablet you buy doesn't have too much wobble. More here: [**diagonal wobble**](../guides/core-features/diagonal-wobble/).

## Buying used drawing tablets

If you buy a used tablet, you could save yourself some significant money but you should be prepared for the issues you might face buying a used tablet. More here: [**Buying a used tablet**](buying-used-drawing-tablets.md)    &#x20;

## Applications

There are a lot of applications that work well with pen tablets depending on what you want to do. More here: [**Applications**](../applications/).

## Scenarios

### Taking notes

I don't recommend drawing tablets for note taking. Devices like an iPad work much better. More here: [**Taking notes with drawing tablets**](../guides/use-cases/taking-notes-with-drawing-tablets.md)&#x20;

### Playing osu!

So if you intend to using a drawing tablet for playing **osu!,** then **DO NOT** rely on my recommendations at this site. My recommendations are for drawing, and if you are playing osu! you need to consider other factors and will have more demanding requirements.&#x20;

So for osu!, consult [**Kuuube's tablet buying guide**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1DYVfiSpQqdpa4sWWYUALPmliOIuGyKog7B7LJJdmlhE/edit#gid=2077726645).&#x20;

## Size / Thickness

Pen tablets are very then these days - about 8mm.

Pen displays are thicker. Smaller pen displays can be around 10mm but as their size grows they get thicker - for example 35mm.&#x20;

## Ergonomics

### Posture

With a pen tablet, your torso will naturally have a more vertical posture. This is because you will be looking at your monitor while you hand rests on the pen tablet which is on your desk.&#x20;

With a pen display, you will be leaning over a bit to draw since you must look at the pen tablet on you desk. You may experience lower back pain or strain on your neck from looking down.&#x20;

### Arm mounting

Pen displays are essentially monitors, and many (but not all), pen displays have a VESA mount on the back that you can put the pen display on. This will allow you to use keep the pen display away and use it like a secondary display and then pull it close when you want to draw.

See: [Using monitor arms with a pen display](../guides/pen-displays/using-monitor-arms-with-a-pen-display.md)&#x20;

Pen tablets do not have any kind of built in ability to be mounted like that.

### Legs

Many pen displays (not not all) have foldable legs on the back. This allows you to keep the pen display at a slight angle on your desk which makes it a bit easier to see and draw on.

Pen tablets do not have legs. If you want to place them at an angle, you will need to find some other solution.

## Maintaining your tablet

Once you get your tablet, you'll need to take care of it and perform some simple maintenance. I've written a guide on this: [**Caring for your tablet**](../guides/caring-for-your-tablet/)     &#x20;
