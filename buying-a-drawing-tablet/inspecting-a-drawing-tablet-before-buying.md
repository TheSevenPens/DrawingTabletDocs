# Inspecting a drawing tablet before buying

## Overview

Occasionally if you're going to buy a tablet you might have an opportunity to try the tablet out before you purchase it. This is often a case when you're getting the tablet from a friend or purchasing it used.

I highly recommend that you test out the tablet before the purchase. This will save you a lot of headaches and disappointment later on.

## Getting prepared to test

For the sake of this discussion I'm going to assume that you're going to bring a laptop with you and use the tablet with that laptop.

Preparation:

* Have the applications installed on the laptop that you're going to use with the tablet. I always test with Krita in addition to any other apps.
* Depending on the brand of the tablet you're considering purchasing make sure you have the latest drivers for that tablet installed.

## **Basic test of functionality**&#x20;

* Connectivity
  * Conduct the tests with a wired connection.
  * Any then verify they work with wireless connection
* Drawing
  * Check if the pen works in all locations on the active area
  * Check if the pressure smoothly going from zero to 100
  * Check tilt works in all directions
  * Check that the pointer generally stays where the tip of the pen is even if you tilt the pen.
  * Check that location of pen is tracked accurately in over the entire surface of the tablet

## **Express keys**

* Check if all the buttons, dials, work. A quick way to test this is to map the buttons to keypresses. Then you can open a notepad app and press the express keys and see it typing things

## **Pen display features**

* Check for stuck or dead pixels
* Check for basic color and brightness
* All pen displays have more pointer lag than pen tablets. Verify if you are OK with the amount it has.
* All pen displays have some minor edge and corner inaccuracy in tracking the pen location. Check this to see how much there is and if you are OK with this.
* Verify you are OK with the anti-glare sparkle on the screen. Some people are very sensitive to this.

## **Surface**

* There should be no cuts or scratches deep enough that you can feel them through the pen

## **Misc**

* Are you getting replacement nibs with the pen?
